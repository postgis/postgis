- size computation functions for deserialized objects

- Implement lwexploded_serialize_buf for speedup of GEOS<=>POSTGIS conversion
  and more!

- box extractor functions writing to a pointer or returning an actual
  object should probably find a way to return NULL (for empty geometries).

- Check spheroid misure functions
	o can't understand if 3d computation works since
	  I get same result w/ 2d and 3d.
	o check if distance can be computed in 3d space

- Check semantic required by OGC functions working on "first geometry
  of a given type". Is the first geometry be to be seeked inside 
  collection elements (currently it is not w/ LWGEOM) ?

- proj support functions might need 3d sometimes.

- GiST index creation tests on PG80a segfaults

- GEOMETRY && BOX2D, GEOMETRY && BOX3D

- try reducing box2d copies in selectivity estimation funx
