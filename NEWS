PostGIS 2.0.0
YYYY/MM/DD

  * Important / Breaking Changes *
  -- #722, #302 Most deprecated functions removed  (Regina Obe, Paul Ramsey)
     (most deprecated in 1.2) removed 
     non-ST variants buffer, 
     length, intersects 
     (and internal functions renamed) etc. 
     If you have been using these - CHANGE your apps or suffer the consequences
     If you don't see a function documented -- it ain't supported
     Some of constraints in older tables were built with deprecated function
     If you restore you may need to rebuild these 
     with populate_geometry_columns()

     for single geometries (Sandro Santilli, Maxime van Noppen)

PostGIS 1.0.0RC1
2005/01/13

- New Things
  - Objects are all now "lightweight" with a smaller disk
	and index representation. Large databases should see a moderate
	to large performance increase.
  - Objects now have a hexidecimal canonical representation.
	To see a "user friendly" version of the objects use the
	AsText() function.
  - The loader and dumper use the hexidecimal canonical representation,
	so coordinate drift due to floating point string parsing is now
	eliminated.
  - New functions: UpdateGeometrySRID(), AsGML(), SnapToGrid(),
	ForceRHR(), estimated_extent(), Accum().
  - Vertical positioning operators.
  - Geometry constructors/editors.
  - Coordinate dimensions handling (up to 4d).
  - API.
  - Join selectivity.
- Bug Fixes
  - Numerous small fixes.
