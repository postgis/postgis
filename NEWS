PostGIS 3.5.0
2024/xx/xx

To take advantage of all postgis_sfcgal extension features SFCGAL 1.5 is needed.
PostgreSQL 12-17 required. GEOS 3.8+ required. Proj 6.1+ required. 

Many thanks to our translation teams, in particular:

Dapeng Wang, Zuo Chenwei from HighGo (Chinese Team)
Teramoto Ikuhiro (Japanese Team)

* Breaking Changes *

  - #5546, TopoGeometry <> TopoGeometry is now ambiguous, to get
           the old behaviour, assuming your TopoGeometry objects
           are named tg1 and tg2, use: (
              id(tg1) <> id(tg2) OR
              topology_id(tg1) <> topology_id(tg2) OR
              layer_id(tg1) <> layer_id(tg2) OR
              type(tg1) <> type(tg2)
           ) (Sandro Santilli)
  - #5536, comments are not anymore included in PostGIS extensions
           (Sandro Santilli)
  - xmllint is now required to build comments (Sandro Santilli)
  - DocBook5 XSL is now required to build html (Sandro Santilli)
  - #5602, Drop support for GEOS 3.6 and 3.7 (Regina Obe)
  - #5571, Improve ST_GeneratePoints performance, but old
           seeded pseudo random points will need to be regenerated.
  - #5596, GH-749, Allow promoting column as an id
           in ST_AsGeoJson(record,..).
           Views and materialized views that use the ST_AsGeoJSON(record ..)
           will need rebuilding to upgrade to new signature
           (Jan Tojnar)
  - #5496, ST_Clip all variants replaced, will require
           rebuilding of materialized views that use them (Regina Obe)
  - #5659, ST_DFullyWithin behaviour has changed to
           be ST_Contains(ST_Buffer(A, R), B) (Paul Ramsey)
  - Remove the WFS_locks extra package. (Paul Ramsey)
  - #5747, GH-776, ST_Length: Return 0 for CurvePolygon (Dan Baston)
  - #5770, support for GEOS 3.13 and RelateNG. Most functionality
           remains the same, but new GEOS predicate implementation
           has a few small changes.
      - Boundary Node Rule relate matrices might be different when
        using the "multi-valent end point" rule.
      - Relate matrices for situations with invalid MultiPolygons
        with shared boundaries might be different. Run ST_MakeValid
        to get valid inputs to feed to the calculation.
      - Zero length LineStrings are treated as if they are the
        equivalent Point object.


* Deprecated signatures *

  - GH-761, ST_StraightSkeleton => CG_StraightSkeleton (Loïc Bartoletti)

      - new command list-enabled
      - new command list-all

      - command status reports status of all databases
