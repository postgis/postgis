* Cache structure. We use GSERIALIZED as keys so no transformations
* are needed before we memcmp them with other keys. We store the
* size to avoid having to calculate the size every time.
* The argnum gives the number of function arguments we are caching.
* Intersects requires that both arguments be checked for cacheability,
* while Contains only requires that the containing argument be checked.
* Both the Geometry and the PreparedGeometry have to be cached,
* because the PreparedGeometry contains a reference to the geometry.
*
* Note that the first 6 entries are part of the common GeomCache
* structure and have to remain in order to allow the overall caching
* system to share code (the cache checking code is common between
* prepared geometry, circtrees, recttrees, and rtrees).
