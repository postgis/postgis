Files in the `external` and `include/flatcc/portable` directories have
separate licenses and copyrights. These have relaxed open source
licenses - either MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, or similar as documented in
these folders.

`include/flatcc/support` files are in part based on snippets posted on online
forums and documented as such in the source.

A minimal set of files have migrated from Googles `flatbuffers` project
in the interest of interoperability: `reflection/reflection.fbs` and
`test/monster_test/monster_test.{fbs,golden,json}`, and grammar syntax
in the `doc` directory. These are covered by the Apache 2.0 license,
copyright Google Inc.

`test/benchmark/flatbench.fbs` and the test data set is based on Googles
FlatBuffers benchmark code by authors permission.

The name `flatcc` which non-coincidentally resembles the `flatc` tool
in the Google FlatBuffers project is used with authors permission.
