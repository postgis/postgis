	  copy objects to a temporary file, then uses canonical binary
	  input
	  to read the objects again into a new table and then compares the
	  original and the final tables.
	  
	  In order for this to work run_test was modified to pass a

	* liblwgeom/Makefile.in, liblwgeom/liblwgeom_internal.h: Switch
	  liblwgeom to use the POSTGIS_* defines already generated by
	  configure, rather than passing them in directly.
	  
	  Similar to my previous commit, however here the aim is that by
	  moving the logic outside of make then we can
	  potentially allow other generators (such as CMake) to detect and
	  use other compilers rather than embedding
	  specific -D flags into the command line.

	  loader/shpcommon.h, postgis_config.h.in: Switch NLS build to use
	  the in-built ENABLE_NLS define rather than USE_NLS.
	  
	  The key concept here is that we eliminate all logic from the
	  Makefile and put
	  it in the build system (e.g. configure). By having the logic at
	  this higher
	  layer, we make it much easier to transition to another build
	  system in future
	  such as CMake.

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* configure.ac: Enable configure to accept the additional parameter

	  #748).

	  regenerate
	  postgis_config.h.in. Along with this fix, we commit an updated
	  version of
	  postgis_config.h created from a fresh invocation of autoheader
	  minus the
	  PACKAGE_* macros.

	  Commit reworked version of shp2pgsql-gui to the repository.
	  
	  As per my email to postgis-devel, this commit contains a major
	  reworking
	  of the inner core, with many bugfixes. The primary changes are:
	  
	  - Elimination of FILENODE, since we can just use pointers to
	  SHPLOADERCONFIG
	  
	  - Abstract the configuration structures from the GUI interface
	  
	  - Restrict entry to either drag/drop or file chooser
	  
	  - Instead of constantly destroying/creating new dialogs, create
	  them once and then just show/hide them (in particular this
	  enables the file chooser to open at its previous directory)
	  
	  - Add separate connection details and progress bar dialogs
	  
	  - Rework both internals and GUI in preparation for adding dumper
	  support
	  
	  Note that the dumper integration changes are being worked on
	  separately
	  and will be included in a later commit.

	  utility to provide a flexible means to reproject, change the
	  scale of, adjust the skew (deskew) of and shift the origin of a
	  raster. RASTER_transform in rt_pg.c has been adjusted to make use
	  of rt_raster_gdal_warp instead of rt_raster_transform. Regression
	  te
	  sts confirm that resulting rasters from rt_raster_gdal_warp are
	  identical to that of rt_raster_transform.
	  
	  The abilities to change a raster's scale, skew and origin have
	  yet to be tested and have no user-accessible SQL functions as of
	  this revision. This will occur in future revisions.
	  
	  The function rt_raster_transform will be removed in a future

	  raster/rt_core/rt_api.c: An argument for git. This massive commit
	  includes the renaming of function in the ptarray API, the removal
	  of some pointArray_* variants in favor of ptarray_* variants,
	  and, importantly, the adition of _append_point and _insert_point
	  options for pointarrays. Functions have been switched over to
	  using the API instead of managing the serialized_pointlist
	  themselves. This has necessitated the re-writing of some
	  functions. Simplify2d and Force2d have been re-written as lwgeom
	  functions instead of serialized form functions, and moved into
	  liblwgeom. There are still some major functions to move into
	  liblwgeom, including the point_in_polygon functions that support
	  the intersects shortcuts and the linear referencing fuctions in
	  lwgeom_functions_analytic.

	* NEWS: add note about GEOS 3.2

2010-01-15 18:41  pramsey

	* liblwgeom/lwgeodetic.c: Short circuit on distance tests: only do
	  full spheroidal calculation where the distance is near or greater
	  than the tolerance. This will make large st_dwithin() radius
	  searches much faster since points that are well within the radius
	  will not have their full geodetic calculation run, only those
	  that are close to the radius boundary.

	  'make clean' in doc, that way they can survive into the tarball
	  build for final release.

2010-01-12 00:25  pramsey

	* postgis/geography_measurement.c: Performance tweak to distance
	  calculations with tolerance. If distance is much less than
	  tolerance, don't bother with geodetic calculation. If distance is
	  close to or greater than tolerance, do the geodetic calculation.
	  Should make st_dwithin faster, avoiding geodetic calculations for
	  points that are clearly within tolerance.

2010-01-11 17:31  kneufeld

	  used for calculation purposes.

2009-12-30 13:08  robe

2009-12-30 12:53  robe

	  problem

2009-12-29 08:52  mcayland

	  went for here was to alter pop() so that "counting tuples" always
	  hold a valid parse position, and then re-write the various check
	  functions to ensure that they only display parse errors with
	  details from the next "counting tuple" higher up in the stack.

2009-11-18 17:19  kneufeld

	  creating a separate "mini install" of PostGIS into the PGXS
	  regression directory that can be used for regression. This is
	  because different architectures have different naming

	  problem of having to know the final architecture library name.

	  confusing to have minimum 8.2 for windows and not for Linux as
	  well)

2009-06-04 15:20  robe

	* README.postgis, doc/installation.xml: change ReadME and
	  installation to change minimum version from 8.1 to 8.2 (not many
	  people are running 8.1 and besides Paul already put in a DROP AGG
	  IF EXISTS in upgrade script -- so binds us to 8.2+ already.
	  Besides I don't think we should be supporting more than 2
	  versions behind of latest PostgreSQL release in our trunk. Too
	  much maintenance. Correct ReadME bug tracker link

2009-06-04 14:17  pramsey

	  postgis_comments.sql as a target to the main makefile
	  
	  Since we don't want to add xsltproc as a dependency, this will
	  remain separate for now:
	  make comments
	  make comments-install
	  
	  (the file should be removed by 'make uninstall')

2009-05-26 17:24  robe

	* doc/reference.xml: make example fit the diagram in text

2009-05-26 17:08  robe

	  doc/html/image_src/st_buffer02.wkt,
	  doc/html/image_src/st_within01.wkt, doc/reference.xml: put in
	  images for buffer, fix within example image and example query

2009-05-26 16:26  robe

	* doc/reference.xml: for consistency make example be same as what
	  is used to generate the image.

2009-05-26 16:24  robe

	  note this seems to go beyond what the spec defines.

2009-05-22 23:22  kneufeld

	* doc/installation.xml: use a docbook variable instead

2009-05-22 23:19  kneufeld

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/installation.xml, doc/installation.xml.in:
	  didn't need the c preprocessor after all

2009-05-22 22:14  kneufeld

	  Updated requirements.

2009-05-22 22:07  kneufeld

	  formatted installation.xml in preparation for editing

2009-05-22 21:32  kneufeld

	* doc/xmlformat.conf: added the xmlformatter conf file for pretty
	  printing the documentation's xml files
	  
	  This will allow us to separate code changes from style changes in
	  the docs.

2009-05-20 11:16  robe

	* doc/html/image_src/st_within01.wkt, doc/reference.xml: Testing
	  out Kevin's auto image generator hopefully I didn't break it.

2009-05-20 10:54  robe

	* doc/reference.xml: Correct ST_GeometryN example -- sign was
	  wrong. Also embellish by showing a multicurve and flag as working
	  for multicurves

	  images
	  added ImageMagick as a dependency

2009-05-09 12:53  mcayland

	* postgis/lwgeom_box3d.c: Fix #178: ST_XMax() and ST_YMax() return
	  incorrect values. This was caused by the fact that the min/max
	  routines did not check whether the result for each axis was
	  actually the min or max, but instead simply returned the
	  structure value. Hence if an inverted coordinate system were
	  being used, the wrong value would be returned.

2009-05-09 12:34  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/lwgunparse.c: Remove a double-free bug caused if the
	  unparser finds an invalid geometry (fixes #168)

2009-05-09 11:46  mcayland

	* loader/shp2pgsql.c: Correct erroneus formatting which was causing
	  two comments to be nested and hence generating a compiler
	  warning.

	  postgis/lwgeom_functions_basic.c, regress/regress.sql,
	  regress/regress_expected: Fix for GBT#96.

2009-03-09 17:19  mcayland

	* spatial_ref_sys.sql: Fix the OSGB 27700 SRID definition in
	  spatial_ref_sys.sql since it is missing a datum parameter. We
	  can't backpatch this since it is only available in newer versions
	  of PROJ, and we don't have any PROJ version detection capability
	  in 1.3 branch.

2009-03-09 16:20  mcayland

	* postgis/lwgeom_dump.c: Remove compile warnings from lwgeom_dump.c
	  related to the removal of TupleDescGetSlot (we don't need to set
	  the deprecated fields in FuncCallContext if we are using
	  BuildTupleFromCStrings).

2009-03-09 15:34  pramsey

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwgeom.c,
	  postgis/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: More camel-case changes.

2009-03-09 14:51  colivier

	* postgis/lwgeom_svg.c: Refactored the whole assvg export function
	  in the same way than asgeojson. Fix #119 issue on big
	  geometrycollection geometry. Keep the same SVG output than before

2009-03-09 14:36  pramsey

	* ChangeLog, liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwalgorithm.c,
	  liblwgeom/lwcollection.c, liblwgeom/lwgeom.c,
	  liblwgeom/lwpoint.c, postgis/lwgeom_dump.c,
	  postgis/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c,

	  postgis/lwgeom_ogc.c, postgis/lwgeom_pg.c,
	  postgis/lwgeom_transform.c: Remove some camelCase function
	  signatures from liblwgeom

2009-03-08 22:33  mcayland

	* postgis/lwgeom_box3d.c, postgis/postgis.sql.in.c,
	  regress/lwgeom_regress_expected: Fix for GBT#93: ST_Extent() and
	  ST_Estimated_Extent() return BOX2DFLOAT4s. This is currently done
	  using a horrible hack for backwards compatibility which
	  introduces a new type just for ST_Extent(). See GBT email to
	  postgis-devel and code comments for more detail.

2009-03-08 21:41  pramsey

	* liblwgeom/lwgeom_api.c: Fix goof in box2d computation.

	  lwgeom_accum.c explaining why we need to implement our own set of
	  geometry aggregate functions.

2009-03-08 16:36  mcayland

	* postgis/lwgeom_box.c, postgis/lwgeom_box3d.c,
	  postgis/lwgeom_functions_basic.c, postgis/lwgeom_pg.h: Alter the
	  in-built casts between the internal PostgreSQL BOX type and the
	  PostGIS geometry/BOX3D types so that they do not go through an
	  intermediate BOX2DFLOAT4 first. This prevents the float4 rounding
	  errors appearing in the numbers when invoking the casts.

2009-03-08 15:37  pramsey

	* liblwgeom/lwgeom_api.c: Fix for GBT #116, EMPTY hex polygon no
	  longer causes crash.

2009-03-08 14:36  mcayland

	* postgis/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c: Fix GBT#122: ST_SnapToGrid
	  gives 13 when fed circular string. Alter the error message so
	  that it correctly displays the type rather than just it's
	  internal number.

2009-03-06 14:15  robe

2009-02-27 18:09  robe

	* postgis/lwgeom_dump.c: Get rid of additional calls to
	  TupleDescGetSlot(tupdesc) in dump and dumprings and replace
	  deprecated use of TupleDescGetSlot with 8.1+ preferred
	  BlessTupleDesc

2009-02-23 15:19  strk

	* liblwgeom/lwgeom_api.c: Fix parse_hex to support lower-case A-F
	  too (issue 120)

	  references from ./lwgeom to ./postgis

2009-02-11 18:22  pramsey

	* lwgeom, postgis: Change the name of the main source directory.
	  This is going to break the build for a little while until I fix
	  all the references, but I want to do it atomically to ensure
	  version history is preserved.

2009-02-11 02:11  pramsey

2009-01-05 00:08  mcayland

	* configure.ac, liblwgeom/Makefile.in, liblwgeom/cunit/Makefile.in:
	  Rework the CUnit detection infrastructure as you can't locate
	  include files based on an absolute path. This is because autoconf
	  and the compiler have differing ideas of the current paths (this
	  totally breaks the Win32 build since you have the extra mapping
	  between UNIX-type MingW paths and Windows-type paths). Hopefully
	  this should not affect existing users at all - if so, please post
	  a report on -devel. I'll try running this on MingW at a later
	  date.
	  
	  I've also enforced "make check" to run the unit tests, rather
	  than "make test". This is a fallout from the early days when strk
	  committed the regression test suite to run using "make test" by
	  accident which appears to have stuck :(
	  .

2009-01-04 20:39  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/lwgeom.c: Fix comment in lwgeom_from_ewkt() and also
	  add a quick error check to lwgeom_from_ewkt() and

	  half-baked geometry back to the caller which would not be good :(

2009-01-04 20:11  mcayland

2009-01-04 19:54  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/cunit/Makefile.in: Add -lm to the cu_tester link line -

2009-01-04 19:24  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/measures.c: Commit quick fix for GBT#85: ST_Distance

2008-12-11 15:56  robe

	* loader/pgsql2shp.c: Incorporated Mark's suggestion to use
	  PQescapeStringConn instead of building a custom function. Also
	  fixed typo. Note using free() instead of PQfree since couldn't
	  find a PQfree. I looked at the 8.3.5 postgresql source code base,

	  characters, adding a "..." to indicate where the string has been
	  trimmed. Truncation can be specified to occur from either the
	  start or end of the string as required. Also update the parser
	  error handler to use the new function.

2008-12-03 16:02  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/ptarray.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_lrs.c: Lightbulb
	  moment: the fix for GBT#21: locate_along_measure: wrong values,
	  invalid data required extra work as floating point errors could
	  still be introduced by the removal of the memcpy(). In fact it
	  was the clipping logic that was wrong, so this patch re-adds the
	  memcpy() in the correct place(s) and corrects the clipping flags
	  to remove this floating point error. With thanks to Stephen
	  Davies.

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_inout.c: Found
	  some new locations containing profiling code outside of the GEOS
	  functions, so swap them over to using the new macros.

2008-11-20 15:00  mcayland

	* configure.ac, lwgeom/lwgeom_geos.c, lwgeom/profile.h,
	  postgis_config.h.in: Switch GEOS profiling over to use
	  conditional macros, much in the same way as LWDEBUG(F) has been
	  implemented. This improves code readability by not having
	  constant #if...#endif sections throughout the code. I've also
	  changed the variable that indicates whether profiling has been
	  enabled to POSTGIS_PROFILE, and integrated it into the autoconf
	  configuration. Hence profiling can be enabled by running
	  configure with the --enable-profile option, or setting
	  POSTGIS_PROFILE in postgis_config.h to 1 and re-compiling.

2008-11-07 14:21  mcayland

2008-11-06 16:12  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos.h, lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_prepared.h: The GEOS 2.2
	  series "geos_c.h" is missing header guards, so including the
	  header multiple times as is done in lwgeom_geos.h and
	  lwgeom_geos_prepared.h causes compilation to fail with multiple
	  definition errors. This patch fixes this problem allowing GEOS
	  2.2 to work with PostGIS once again, although of course it can
	  easily be removed when it is decided that GEOS 2.2 support is no
	  longer required.

2008-11-06 15:15  mcayland

	* configure.ac, lwgeom/Makefile.in, topology/Makefile.in: Change
	  configure to check for the existence of the PGXS Makefile, even
	  if pg_config can be found. This is become distributions such as
	  Debian install pg_config as part of libpq-dev but this package
	  doesn't contain the required Makefile. Per bug report from strk.

	  proper type name instead of just a number.

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c: Fix for GBT#65: ST_AsGML kills the backend
	  when fed a CIRCULAR STRING. The default code attempts to inspect
	  any unknown geometry which fails on CIRCULARSTRING. A longer term
	  fix may be to fix CIRCULARSTRING so that it can be inspected,
	  however the fix here is to throw an ERROR for unknown types just
	  as the other As_*() functions do.

	  convention.

2008-11-04 09:57  mcayland

	* loader/Makefile.in: Alter loader Makefile to add liblwgeom.a

	* loader/Makefile.in: Add missing ICONV_LDFLAGS variable to the
	  loader Makefile. Thanks to Olivier Courtin for noticing.

2008-11-03 16:17  mcayland

	* loader/Makefile.in, loader/pgsql2shp.c, loader/wkb.h: Switch
	  pgsql2shp over to using liblwgeom.
	  
	  There are few commits that can be as satisfying as one which
	  involves the removal of ~1200 lines of code. By using the
	  liblwgeom parser instead of the in-built parser, we have now
	  achieved the following:
	  
	  i) all parsers within PostGIS, shp2pgsql and pgsql2shp are now
	  the same which means they all follow the same rules. Also
	  extended error reporting information including error text and
	  position information is available.
	  
	  ii) the complexity of the shp2pgsql/pgsql2shp is considerably
	  reduced.
	  
	  The slightly unfortunate cost is the overall executable size is
	  larger, since we are linking with liblwgeom. However, from both a
	  consistency and maintainability point of view, this is a big win.
	  Note that while there may be a difference in behaviour in some
	  corner cases, all regression tests pass here.

2008-10-31 10:41  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwgeom.c: Add missing
	  serialized_lwgeom_from_hexwkb() function to liblwgeom which is
	  required for adding liblwgeom support to pgsql2shp.

2008-10-31 10:04  mcayland

	* loader/shp2pgsql.c: Some more shp2pgsql clearups; remove some
	  dead commented code and switch over to use the LWDEBUG(F)
	  debugging framework.

2008-10-30 23:13  mcayland

	* doc/reference_new.xml, lwgeom/lwgeom_geojson.c,
	  regress/geojson.sql, regress/geojson_expected: Fix regression
	  test differences between different platforms in the AsGeoJSON
	  regression code. There were two issues: firstly, the original
	  regression tests included precision information > 15 significant
	  figures, and secondly the GeoJSON code was exposing BOX2DFLOAT4
	  information to the client instead of calculating the true
	  bounding box. With thanks to Olivier Courtin.

2008-10-30 22:48  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over ST_DumpRings

2008-10-30 17:10  mcayland

	* loader/Makefile.in, loader/shp2pgsql.c: Switch shp2pgsql over to
	  use liblwgeom instead of its own internal parser. Some notes from
	  looking at the code:
	  
	  i) I've abstracted the I/O formatting functions into a new
	  OutputGeometry() function since it allow the logic concerning
	  output formatting to kept in one place, rather than sprinkled
	  throughout all the other Insert* functions.
	  
	  ii) InsertPoint() and InsertMultiPoint() have been combined,
	  since it seems that the same code will work for both - all that
	  is required is to know whether to produce a MULTIPOINT collecton
	  or a POINT at the end.
	  
	  iii) I've added additional comments within the Insert* functions
	  to help clarify what is going on in places
	  
	  iv) It appears some corner cases were missing within the
	  conversion code with respect to Z/M coordinates, so in theory the
	  new code should do a better job.
	  
	  All in all, the source code is slightly reduced in size (although
	  of course the binary is larger after linking with liblwgeom), and
	  seems a lot more readable to my eyes. A quick TODO is to go
	  through the file and replace the #if...#endif sections related to
	  debugging with LWDEBUG(F) options.
	  
	  NOTE: I've had to change the Makefile to allow linking against
	  the maths library and liblwgeom.a, so some manual intervention on
	  the automated build may be required ;)

	  building PDF's
	  added a pdf target to doc/Makefile.in

2008-10-16 08:33  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c: Update to previous parser patch: if the error
	  location is 0 (i.e. we haven't even matched a valid OGC WKT type)
	  then display a more appropriate message. Per minor gripe from
	  Paul.

2008-10-16 07:22  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: update st_azimuth - it should be called
	  vector instead of line since order of points reverses the angle

2008-10-16 07:17  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over ST_Azimuth
	  and provide example

2008-10-16 06:35  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml,
	  doc/xsl/postgis_aggs_mm.xml.xsl: Move over ST_Boundary to new
	  section, copy comment about SQL-MM srid to xsl header

2008-10-15 21:44  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c: Fix pointer problem in the new HINT code
	  caused by strncpy() not padding with zeros unless the specified
	  length is *longer* than the source string.

2008-10-15 18:36  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_box2dfloat4.c: last one!

2008-10-15 18:26  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gist.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_inout.c: expunge remaining
	  stringBuffer references

2008-10-15 17:59  pramsey

	* lwgeom/Makefile.in, lwgeom/lwgeom_gist.c, lwgeom/stringBuffer.c,
	  lwgeom/stringBuffer.h: Remove stringBuffer.* from
	  build/repository.

2008-10-15 15:03  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwgparse.c,

	  lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.h, regress/regress_expected,
	  regress/regress_ogc_expected, regress/wkt_expected: Update the

	  PostgreSQL, and update regression tests accordingly.

2008-10-15 13:43  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: fix spacing of st_linemerge, st_segmentize
	  examples.

2008-10-15 13:39  robe

	  lwgeom/lwgeom_ogc.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.h,
	  regress/regress_ogc_expected: Nearly finish work on the new
	  parser API. The key part of this patch is to alter the behaviour
	  of the parser so that instead of generating errors directly, it
	  returns an error code, error location and an error message. Hence
	  the caller is now in charge of the behaviour when parsing invalid
	  geometries, and so can ignore errors or proceed onto the next
	  geometry if required. The regression test change is due to a
	  change in an error message, since the error is now returned from
	  the unparser before it even gets to GEOS.

	  style=ansi indent=tab=8

2008-10-14 11:40  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: completely move over
	  rest of management functions to new section. Add
	  probe_geometry_columns - never been documented, but useful. Get
	  rid of update_geometry_stats - just returns a dumb message that
	  its obsolete.

2008-10-14 03:56  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: Add missing function proto for
	  dropgeometrytable

2008-10-13 13:16  mcayland

	  parser_check_flags to current_parser_check_flags and
	  unparser_check_flags to current_unparser_check_flags to clarify
	  that these status variables only reflect the checks enabled for
	  the current parse.

2008-10-13 13:03  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/examples/unparser.c: Move the liblwgeom unparser
	  example over to the dynptarray API which is the proper way to

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_prepared.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_prepared.h: Fix up some more warnings in SVN
	  trunk; note that there are still 2 remaining PreparedGeometry
	  warnings, but these will require patching GEOS.

2008-10-12 17:47  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gist.c: Performance boost: only detoast the front
	  of the tuple first and
	  extract the bbox from that.

2008-10-10 16:34  pramsey

2008-09-30 13:29  mcayland

	* regress/regress_lrs.sql, regress/regress_lrs_expected: Update
	  regression tests to include test cases for GBT#21.

2008-09-30 13:25  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_lrs.c: Fix for locate_along_measure

2008-09-30 04:06  kneufeld

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/postgis.xml,
	  doc/xsl/postgis_aggs_mm.xml.xsl: added a new aggregate and sql_mm

	  Update LWGEOM unparser to (E)WKT/WKB to resturn a
	  LWGEOM_UNPARSER_RESULT structure instead of just the WKT/WKB
	  character array. This is the same work done for r3023 but applied
	  to the unparser instead.

2008-09-28 16:18  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwgeom.c, liblwgeom/lwgparse.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_inout.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_ogc.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c:
	  With the advent of LWGEOM_PARSER_RESULT, it is now possible to
	  get rid of the horrible SERIALIZED_LWGEOM hack for PostgreSQL 8.3
	  to allow us to return the size separate from the result. This is
	  good as it removes another level of indirection from the parser.
	  Note that the size field has now been added to the
	  LWGEOM_PARSER_RESULT structure.

2008-09-28 15:47  mcayland

2008-09-27 08:19  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/lwgunparse.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c:
	  Rename parser_check_flags to unparser_check_flags for the

	  function prototype to silence compiler warning in the PiP code.

2008-09-26 21:46  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in.c: harmonize sql

	* doc/xsl/postgis_aggs_mm.xml.xsl: correct the comments

2008-09-26 18:55  robe

	  of postgis spatial aggregates and MM compliant functions

2008-09-26 12:45  robe

	* doc/xsl/postgis_comments.sql.xsl: Put in author/license info (hmm

	  Also comment on what xsl is doing.

2008-09-26 02:50  kneufeld

	  for the (E)WKB/WKT to LWGEOM parsers.

2008-09-25 21:34  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_rtree.c: Remove missing variables from LWDEBUG(F)

2008-09-23 21:32  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/vsprintf.c: Use __va_copy() to pass a copy of the

2008-09-23 19:53  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwutil.c, liblwgeom/vsprintf.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.h: Refactor the memory management routines to
	  account for the fact that variadic functions can't be called
	  directly from the initial allocators. Also solve issues related
	  to differences between the system vasprintf() (if supplied) and
	  the liblwgeom vasprintf() by renaming to lw_vasprintf() and using
	  it throughout PostGIS. With all this in place, GBT#54 is fixed
	  which is very useful when debugging ;)

2008-09-23 19:07  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_rtree.c: Reduce p-i-p memory leak by 50%

2008-09-23 13:05  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: fix typo add more links

2008-09-23 13:00  robe

2008-09-22 17:55  robe

	* doc/xsl/postgis_comments.sql.xsl: change to xsl 1.0 plus minor
	  indent change

2008-09-22 12:28  robe

	* doc/xsl, doc/xsl/postgis_comments.sql.xsl: Add xsl file that
	  autogenerates sql set comment statements from reference_new.xml

2008-09-22 12:18  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: Realized from my sql comment generation
	  xsl that there is really no ST_WKTToSQL that takes an SRID and no
	  ST_BD.. that doesn't take an SRID. Very shocking.

2008-09-21 23:15  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: typo in st_setsrid returns geometry not
	  boolean

2008-09-18 22:12  pramsey

	* liblwgeom, lwgeom: Add a few more generated files to ignore

2008-09-18 22:09  pramsey

	* ., doc, liblwgeom, loader, lwgeom, regress, topology: Set ignore
	  properties on generated files.

2008-09-18 13:54  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/lwgunparse.c: Update the code for unparsing LWGEOMs to
	  WKB/WKT so that it includes the standard simple checks:
	  LINESTRINGs must have > 2 points, POLYGONs must have closed rings
	  and CIRCULARSTRINGs must have > 2 points and the number of points
	  must be odd. There is still a little more work to do to allow
	  flags to be passed into the parser to specify which checks should
	  be enforced, much like has already been done for the parsing from
	  WKB/WKT to LWGEOM.

2008-09-18 04:34  kneufeld

2008-09-17 14:46  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: Link ST_SetSRID to updated spatial_ref_sys
	  section using cutesy anchor.

2008-09-17 14:41  robe

	* liblwgeom/liblwgeom.h, liblwgeom/lwsegmentize.c,
	  liblwgeom/lwutil.c: Silence a few more compiler warnings that had
	  appeared during my last few parser commits.

2008-09-16 22:29  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/examples, liblwgeom/examples/Makefile,
	  liblwgeom/examples/README, liblwgeom/examples/unparser.c: Add an
	  example of how the liblwgeom API can be used by other C programs
	  to manipulate geometries and output the result. Currently the
	  unparser.c program shows how a geometry can be constructed "on
	  the fly" and then exported in both WKT and HEXWKB formats;
	  however it gives programmers the potential to devise some very
	  unique processing tools which can generate files that can be
	  loaded into PostGIS.

2008-09-16 18:44  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/Makefile.in, liblwgeom/lwsegmentize.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_sqlmm.c: Move the LWGEOM-specific functions from
	  lwgeom_sqlmm.c into liblwgeom/lwsegmentize.c to ensure that
	  liblwgeom can exist as a standalone library.

	  duration of contribution, b) frequency of contributions,
	  c)recency of contributions, d) impact of contributions,
	  and add some new contributors (more need to be added)

2008-09-11 12:18  mcayland

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.in: Reinstate the PDF documentation
	  system based on OpenJade, including integration with autoconf.
	  "make postgis.pdf" should now output lovely PDF format
	  documentation :)

2008-09-11 12:04  mcayland

	* doc/reference_new.xml, doc/using_postgis.xml: Documentation fixes
	  to allow PDF documents to be generated from Docbook source using

	  lwgeom/lwgeom_inout.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_ogc.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c:
	  Allow a flags parameter to be passed into the WKT parser to

	* liblwgeom/lex.yy.c, liblwgeom/wktparse.tab.c,
	  liblwgeom/wktparse.tab.h: Commit generated versions of the new
	  parser files for people who do not have flex or bison installed.

2008-09-08 20:16  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/wktparse.lex, liblwgeom/wktparse.y: Enhance geometry
	  parser so that it keeps track of the current position during
	  parsing. With a bit more work, this should allow error messages
	  to pinpoint the exact location of an invalid geometry section or
	  syntax error.

2008-09-08 13:12  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over ST_Translate

	  lwgeom/lwgeom_ogc.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c: Yet another update to
	  the liblwgeom parser API - lwgeom_from_ewkt() has been renamed to
	  serialized_lwgeom_from_ewkt() to indicate that the function
	  returns a serialied LWGEOM rather than an unserialized LWGEOM
	  structure.

	  Move around instructions putting geos and proj compilation steps
	  at the end per Mark's request

2008-08-27 04:34  kneufeld

	  some reason.

2008-08-22 12:32  robe

	* doc/installation.xml: Typo

2008-08-22 12:14  robe

	* doc/installation.xml: Updated the installations docs. I took some
	  of Olivier Courtin instructions for install
	  (http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-August/020746.html)
	  which seemed much easier to follow than the ones we currently
	  have. Also corrected path settings we had to the install files.
	  They are all in downloads not root of postgis as we suggested.

2008-08-21 11:27  mcayland

	* README.postgis: Update PostGIS README file to account for changes
	  in SVN trunk.

2008-08-21 10:56  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gist.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in.c: Update PostGIS
	  SVN trunk to use the new 8.4 GiST API (where RECHECK is now
	  specified within the consistent function, rather than being
	  supplied as part of the operator class definition). This allows
	  PostGIS to compile and pass regression tests on the latest
	  PostgreSQL 8.4 CVS HEAD.

2008-08-21 08:45  mcayland

	* loader/Makefile.pgsql2shp.in, loader/Makefile.shp2pgsql.in,
	  lwgeom/Makefile.in: Alter the lwgeom Makefile so that liblwgeom.a
	  is linked directly, rather than using the -L...-l options on the
	  command line. This is to prevent problems on OSX where PGXSadds
	  the PostgreSQL $libdir to the PostGIS link line, causing it to
	  link to liblwgeom.so produced by older versions of PostGIS rather
	  than the static liblwgeom.a.
	  
	  Also change the PGXS CPP/LIB equivalent variables to use += so
	  that extra compile/link options can be supplied. Per report from
	  Robert Rainthorpe, with thanks to William Kyngesburye.

2008-08-12 16:42  pramsey

	* doc/html/images/st_crosses-math.gif,
	  doc/html/images/st_touches-math.gif, doc/reference_new.xml:
	  Reverted html markup for mathematical expressions in ST_Touches
	  and ST_Crosses to a gif image. It seems unicode markup does not
	  work well for both IE and Firefox. The next best thing to do is
	  to get MathML markup working.

2008-08-01 04:42  kneufeld

	* doc/reference_new.xml: small grammar correction in ST_Touches

2008-08-01 04:26  kneufeld

	  error.

2008-07-31 12:14  robe

2008-07-30 14:05  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over ST_WKTToSQL
	  and also defined ST_GeometryFromText (didn't see it in the old
	  docs, but its not deprecated and is a popular variant)

2008-07-30 11:41  robe

	* lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in.c, lwgeom/sqlmm.sql.in: Got rid pf
	  superfluous redirection to deprecated functions of ST_GeomFromWkb
	  and ST_GeomFromText - now they just point directly to the c
	  functions. Changed all FromWKB, FromText variants to point to the
	  non-deprecated ST_GeomFrom, ST_BuildArea etc. (before they were
	  pointing at deprecated functions)

2008-07-29 15:46  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: grammatical error

2008-07-29 15:42  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over ST_Collect
	  and ST_Union, provide examples for ST_Union. Get rid of comment
	  about don't use ST_Union with geometry collections - seems to
	  work fine with those.

2008-07-29 12:35  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: typo in function declare for perimeter

2008-07-29 12:00  robe

	  doc/html/images/st_centroid04.png, doc/reference.xml,
	  doc/reference_new.xml: moved over st_centroid and provided
	  examples in both svg and png format. Eventually, ImageMagick will
	  be used to generate the png files, but for now they are committed
	  into svn.

2008-07-29 04:42  robe

	* doc/reference_new.xml: minor formatting changes, note about
	  ST_NumPOints being an alias for ST_NPoints moving forward.

2008-07-28 19:05  kneufeld

	  miscellaneous references.

2008-07-28 10:03  mcayland

	* configure.ac, loader/Makefile.pgsql2shp.in,
	  loader/Makefile.shp2pgsql.in, lwgeom/Makefile.in,
	  topology/Makefile, topology/Makefile.in: Allow Makefile
	  substitutions for PGCONFIG which are required if pg_config is not
	  located in the path. Note that as part of this fix, we now need
	  to generate topology/Makefile using autoconf. Thanks to Jorgen
	  Austvik for the report and partial patch.

2008-07-28 09:13  mcayland

	* liblwgeom/Makefile.in: Fix -o option for flex; the output

	  preceding white space. Per report from Jorgen Austvik.

2008-07-24 11:58  robe

	* doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Move over
	  ST_GeomFromText and provide examples

2008-07-24 10:22  mcayland

	* configure.ac: Add PROJ.4 version check to ensure that a minimum
	  version of 4.5.0 is installed. This is to ensure that the
	  pj_set_searchpath() function is present (note: it was actually
	  added in 4.4.9, however we version detect on major.minor rather
	  than major.minor.release)

2008-07-24 05:55  kneufeld

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/reference.xml, doc/reference_new.xml: Moved
	  several version functions to the new PostGIS reference.

2008-07-23 17:13  kneufeld

	  ICONV_LDFLAGS is explicitly set in the AC_CHECK_LIB()
	  action-if-found section (LIBS does not get automatically set when
	  action-if-found is set). Thanks to Olivier Courtin for the bug
	  report.

2008-07-14 10:05  mcayland

2008-07-01 14:15  mcayland

	* configure.ac, liblwgeom/Makefile.in: Fix liblwgeom requiring gcc

	  Split the basic geometry accessors into a separate static library
	  liblwgeom.a; this potentially allows re-use of the liblwgeom
	  functions from within PostGIS, or could be extended at a later
	  date to include databases other than MySQL. This patch includes a
	  change to the liblwgeom handler functions; instead of sprinkling
	  init_pg_func()s around the source, I have changed the default
	  liblwgeom handlers to make use of a callback to allow linked
	  libraries to set their own handlers the first time any of them
	  are called. I have also tidied up the parser API a little in
	  liblwgeom.h, which means wktparse.h can be removed from all of
	  the headers in the lwgeom/ directory, plus renamed wktunparse.c
	  to lwgunparse.c to keep things similar to lwgparse.c. Finally, I
	  renamed liblwgeom.c to lwutil.c to avoid confusion within the new
	  interface. TODO: the liblwgeom Makefile has some gcc-specific
	  options, but these can be fixed later - it seemed more important
	  to make the warnings visible to developers.

	  PostgreSQL functions. To enable debugging, run configure with
	  --enable-debug and then remake the entire project. If
	  --enable-debug is omitted during configure, the above macros
	  evaluate to (void)0, and hence should be removed by the compiler
	  during optimisation. Also: contains minor warning cleanups and a
	  fix for the ST_Dwithin SQL definition.

	  "make install" now works. Maybe this will fix the on-line website
	  build?

2008-05-22 14:31  mcayland

	* topology/Makefile, topology/topology.sql.in,
	  topology/topology.sql.in.c: Update topology/ directory to use the
	  new PGXS build system.

2008-05-20 22:24  mcayland

	* doc/Makefile, doc/Makefile.in: Update previous commit: add
	  Makefile.in and remove Makefile, since Makefile is now generated
	  from Makefile.in automatically.

2008-05-20 22:10  mcayland

	* configure.in, doc/Makefile: Rework the documentation Makefile so
	  that it works with the autoconf build system.

2008-05-14 17:24  mcayland

	* GNUmakefile: Fixes for previous commit: missed Makefile.config
	  target for "make clean"

2008-05-14 17:19  mcayland

	* GNUmakefile, lwgeom/sqldefines.h: Fixes for previous commit:
	  Alter GNUmakefile to understand that Makefile.config no longer
	  exists, plus remove lwgeom/sqldefines.h as it is generated by
	  autoconf

2008-04-12 16:44  pramsey

	* loader/shp2pgsql.c: New -n switch to support DBF-only loading of
	  attributes without shapes.
	  Submitted by Regina Obe.

2008-04-12 10:16  mcayland

	* regress/regress_ogc_expected: Remove svn:eol-style from
	  regress_ogc_expected; MingW requires unix line endings in order
	  for the diff to work as expected.

2008-04-10 14:44  pramsey

	* loader/pgsql2shp.c: Reduce FTDate field size to 8 bytes from 10.
	  Matches other calls in the file
	  now, no good explanation in code why it was 10 to start with.
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-April/019169.html

2008-04-10 06:40  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_estimate.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_jts.c: Another round of
	  PostgreSQL 8.3 fixes, this time related to arrays. Make sure that
	  we use the supplied ArrayType pointer macros, instead of
	  attempting to access to cast directly to ArrayType. This resolved
	  GBT#13 where a "corrupted histogram" error is thrown when using
	  using ST_EstimatedExtent() under 8.3.

2008-04-09 19:52  pramsey

	* loader/shp2pgsql.c: Change sr_id into an integer, per mca's
	  suggestion.

2008-04-08 21:36  pramsey

	  OS/X 10.5 system function name collision.

2008-04-07 19:47  pramsey

	* regress/kml.sql: Fix the ST_AsKML regression tests.

	  regress/regress_ogc.sql, regress/regress_ogc_cover.sql,
	  regress/regress_ogc_cover_expected, regress/regress_ogc_expected:

	  cover/prepared tests into the appropriate buckets. Fix the
	  AT_AsKML
	  regression tests.

2008-04-05 14:49  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom.h: remove unloved header file

2008-03-31 11:16  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_transform.c: Remove the code that adds
	  share/contrib/nad to the PROJ.4 search path for PostgreSQL < 8.0
	  since the mechanism for determining the path has changed from
	  earlier versions, and this was mainly for Win32 users. Also
	  rename nad/ directory to proj/ to keep it inline with an existing
	  PROJ.4 installation.

2008-03-28 21:04  pramsey

	* ChangeLog, lwgeom/lwgeom_kml.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in: Added

2008-03-28 20:18  pramsey

	* lwgeom/Makefile: Changed ifeq to ifndef for CXX macro test.

2008-03-28 20:17  pramsey

	* geos_version.sh: Removed unloved and un-used geos_version.sh
	  file.

2008-03-28 20:03  pramsey

	* ChangeLog, doc/postgis.xml, lwgeom/lwgeom_svg.c: Added SVN
	  support patch from Dr. Marco Hugentobler, as described in
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2008-February/002883.html

2008-03-28 19:25  pramsey

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.config.in, configure.in, lwgeom/Makefile,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in: Added
	  GEOS_VERNUM macro and protected GEOS 3.0/3.1 functionality behind
	  it.

2008-03-28 18:55  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: Fix crash caused by double-free
	  in LWGEOM_same - we were accidentally freeing the 1st parameter
	  twice instead of freeing the second parameter. Thanks to Cliff
	  Wright for the bug report.

2008-03-28 17:05  pramsey

	* regress/Makefile: Removed regress_ogc_prep from tests temporarily
	  until a new GEOS is released with support
	  for new predicates.

2008-03-27 21:18  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_box2dfloat4.c: Fix bug with |>> and <<| operators -
	  the BOX2D overabove and overbelow functions were actually wrong,
	  causing index scans to return the wrong results. Per bug report
	  from Tomas Karlsson.

2008-03-26 03:40  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml: Change link to postgis bug tracker

2008-03-21 08:17  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c: Resolve
	  GBT bugs #2,#3 and #9 related to crashes when calling aggregate
	  functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 (all earlier versions would not
	  see the error). This was due to missing more VARSIZE macros in
	  the PostgreSQL 8.3 conversion. The complete list of affected
	  functions under PostgreSQL 8.3 is: ST_force_2d(), ST_force_3dz(),
	  ST_force_3dm(), ST_force_4d(), ST_Collect(), ST_MakeLine(),
	  ST_Polygonize(), ST_Union()/ST_GeomUnion(),
	  ST_MakePolygon()/ST_Polygon().

2008-02-12 15:03  pramsey

	* ChangeLog, lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in: Added
	  hook to GEOSTopologyPreserveSimplify

2008-01-29 01:24  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in,
	  regress/Makefile, regress/regress_ogc_prep.sql,
	  regress/regress_ogc_prep_expected: Changed the interface for the
	  GEOS prepared predicates.
	  ST_contains, ST_containsProperly, ST_covers, and ST_intersects
	  are now overloaded.
	  The new arguments style is ( geometry, geometry, integer). The
	  third argument is used to determine when the first argument
	  changes. The assumption is that when the third argument changes,
	  the first argument is assumed to have changed too. This
	  side-steps the issue of determining when the identity of the
	  first geometry changes.

2008-01-22 19:44  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c: Ammended to include prepared geometry
	  cache code in scope of PREPARED_GEOM symbol.

2008-01-22 00:24  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c: Modified to check version of GEOS and
	  stub out prepared predicates if GEOS is prior to 3.1.0

2008-01-18 18:57  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c: Made some minor changes suggested by Mark
	  Cave-Ayland.

2008-01-18 01:05  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in: Added new function wrappers to expose
	  prepared geometry predicates:
	  ST_ContainsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_ContainsProperlyPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_CoversPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  ST_IntersectsPrepared( geometry, geometry )
	  
	  as well, this function was added, for orthogonality:
	  ST_ContainsProperly( geometry, geometry )

2008-01-18 01:04  benjubb

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_geos_c.c: Added new functions to lwgeom_geos_c.c to
	  support prepared geometry predicates.
	  bool containsPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool containsProperlyPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool coversPrepared( geom, geom)
	  bool intersectsPrepared( geom, geom)

2008-01-18 00:59  benjubb

	* regress/regress_ogc_prep.sql, regress/regress_ogc_prep_expected:
	  Tests for the prepared geometry predicates.
	  The tests were copied from regress_ogc, and modified.
	  Most of the tests use a pattern where the same function is
	  invoked three times with the same argument.
	  This tests the prepared geometry caching mechanism.
	  This testfile haven't been added to regress/Makefile yet, as it
	  fails for one case. This
	  probably due to a bug in GEOS.

2008-01-11 15:05  mcayland

	* Version.config: Bump version number to 1.3.3SVN for next
	  development cycle.

2008-01-11 15:04  mcayland

	* loader/pgsql2shp.c, lwgeom/Makefile: Rewrite the pgsql2shp
	  connection string code so that it uses a connection string,
	  rather than setting environment variables. MingW-compiled and
	  MSVC-compiled apps seem to have great problems passing the
	  variables to each other, causing regression to fail. With this
	  fix (and a Makefile tweak), it is now possible to run a
	  MingW-compiled PostGIS against an MSVC compiled PostgreSQL and
	  pass all regression tests.

2007-12-03 23:10  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml: Fix up bad entities and screwed up
	  programlistings from some previous pretty-printing
	  run on the XML.

2007-12-02 20:37  mcayland

	* ChangeLog, README.postgis: Commit updated versions of the
	  ChangeLog and README.postgis (also change some references in
	  README.postgis from "run as root" to "run as postgres", and
	  correct the --with-pgsql and --with-geos documentation)

2007-11-30 18:19  pramsey

	* NEWS, doc/postgis.xml: Added release notes.

2007-11-30 13:04  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgparse.c: Fix the (E)WKB parser so that it performs
	  validation checks in the same way as the WKT parser, e.g. ensure
	  POLYGON rings are closed, LINESTRINGs consist of at least 2
	  points and that curves have at least 3 points. As discovered when
	  looking simplify() bug submitted by Ivan Mincik.

2007-11-27 22:39  mcayland

	* lwgeom/liblwgeom.h, lwgeom/lwcurve.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_api.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_pg.c, lwgeom/lwline.c, lwgeom/lwpoint.c,
	  lwgeom/lwpoly.c: Rename the existing get_int32() and get_uint32()
	  functions to lw_get_int32() and lw_get_uint32() respectively in
	  order to avoid a collision with functions of the same name in
	  newer versions of OS X. This should resolve the problem with
	  PostGIS crashing on some OS X installations. Many thanks to
	  William Kyngesburye and others for resolving this issue.

2007-11-27 22:19  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_transform.c: Extend the PROJ.4 search path to
	  include $sharedir/contrib/postgis/nad when looking for grid
	  files. This is mainly to allow Win32 builds to find grid files
	  without having to use a PROJ.4 DLL compiled containing a fixed
	  path.

2007-11-23 10:42  mcayland

	* loader/shp2pgsql.c: Apply Tom Glancy's patch to shp2pgsql which
	  corrects an off-by-one error in the field_width calculation when
	  determining which SQL numeric type is required depending upon the
	  length of the corresponding shapefile field. This should
	  eliminate various out of range error messages that may have
	  appeared when attempting to load a converted shapefile into
	  PostgreSQL.

2007-11-23 10:24  mcayland

	* java/jdbc/Makefile, java/jdbc/build.xml: Commit a first attempt
	  at an Ant build.xml file for the PostGIS JDBC driver so finally
	  all the Java drivers build with Ant for consistency, plus we
	  eliminate numerous cross platform problems. As it stands, the
	  build.xml file supports only the standard JDBC driver - if you
	  wish to use a JTS-enabled JDBC driver or run the online
	  regression tests then you must still use the Makefile. Any help
	  porting the remaining parts of the Makefile would be appreciated.

2007-10-29 16:29  mcayland

	* loader/pgsql2shp.c, lwgeom/lwcurve.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_dump.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_rtree.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_transform.c: Apply parts of
	  Charlie Savage's MSVC patch - mainly tidying up variable
	  allocations so they appear at the start of functions, but also
	  making better use of the pj_get_errno_ref() which gets rid of the
	  auto-import warnings on MingW.

2007-10-29 14:22  mcayland

	* lwgeom/Makefile: Remove version numbers from liblwgeom references
	  in lwpostgis.sql as per
	  http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-devel/2007-September/002764.html.
	  This should help make upgrades a lot easier for people since it
	  removes the need to change the SQL function definitions when
	  upgrading version. Note that this is a quick and dirty fix as I
	  didn't want to change Makefile.shlib too much - as soon as we
	  remove support for PostgreSQL < 8.0, we can use PGXS instead and
	  thus remove the redundant shared library code from PostGIS.

2007-10-29 13:44  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_box2dfloat4.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_box3d.c,
	  lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: Commit Charlie Savage's patches
	  (with additional comments) to the bounding box/envelope functions
	  to ensure that valid geometries are always returned; in more
	  specific terms, if a bounding box is a point then a POINT is
	  returned, and if a bounding box is 1-dimensional a LINESTRING is
	  returned. Otherwise a POLYGON is returned as per the old
	  behaviour. For details see the thread in the postgis-users
	  archives Sept 2007 'How to get the centroid of an bounding box
	  using st_extent'.

2007-10-29 12:34  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwpoint.c: Fix broken error message when attempting to
	  deserialise a type other than a point; the message should now
	  correctly show the name of the offending type. Patch supplied by
	  Charlie Savage.

2007-10-23 00:19  pramsey

	* CREDITS, lwgeom/lwgeom_kml.c, regress/kml.sql: KML credits patch
	  <yecarrillo>

2007-10-10 21:27  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c: Apply extra fixes for the reworked AsGML()
	  function to ensure that enough memory is allocated for the GML
	  output. Patch supplied by Barbara Phillipot.

2007-09-28 10:18  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c: Fix a mistake in my refactoring of the
	  AsGML() patch for GML3 support - the detoasted geometry is now
	  the second argument rather than the first. Per report from
	  Olivier Courtin.

2007-09-19 05:01  pramsey

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_basic.c: Applied patch from Charlie
	  Savage to make ST_Envelope return a POINT
	  when the input geometry is a POINT or a one-part MULTIPOINT.

2007-09-06 16:03  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml, lwgeom/lwgeom_gml.c, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in:
	  Commit modified version of Barbara Phillipot's GML patch to fix
	  existing output to make it GML2 compliant, plus add GML3 output
	  capability

2007-08-22 15:09  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml, lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in: Rename ST_GeomUnion to
	  ST_Union in docs and ST_MemGeomUnion to ST_MemUnion in
	  .sql.

2007-08-21 23:02  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_ogc.c: Fix crash when calling ST_EndPoint caused by
	  a double-free in LWGEOM_endpoint_linestring. This bug has been
	  there for a while - thanks to Eric Francois for the bug report.

2007-08-15 14:39  snowman

	* extras/tiger_geocoder/geocode/geocode_location.sql: - Include
	  levenshtein difference in rating when doing city/state match.

2007-08-13 15:51  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml: Fixed spelling error for the word "geometry"
	  thanks to Regina Obe, plus added comment about initial PostgreSQL
	  8.3 support.

2007-08-13 07:27  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml: This time really fix the documentation missing
	  tag problem...

2007-08-13 07:14  mcayland

	* doc/postgis.xml: Fix documentation since an error in the 1.3.0
	  release notes xml caused the build to fail (this may need author
	  review)

2007-08-13 07:06  mcayland

	* lwgeom/lwgeom.c: Remove warning about unused variable in lwgeom.c
	  (it was a leftover from the PostgreSQL 8.3 compatibility patch)

2007-08-09 22:50  mleslie

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README.postgis, Version.config, doc/postgis.xml:
	  Added release notes and updated version numbers and release
	  dates.

2007-08-09 22:19  mleslie

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_jts.c: Moved the intersects method back to the
	  original definition and disabled the new apparently broken
	  implementation.

2007-08-09 16:57  mleslie

	* Version.config: Bumped the version number to RC5.

2007-08-09 16:56  mleslie

	* regress/sql-mm-circularstring.sql,
	  regress/sql-mm-circularstring_expected.in,

	  regress/sql-mm-multicurve_expected.in,
	  regress/sql-mm-multisurface.sql,
	  regress/sql-mm-multisurface_expected.in: Updated the regression
	  tests for curved geoms to avoid the byte ordering problems.

2007-08-03 20:58  mleslie

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_jts_wrapper.cpp: Removed an unused function that
	  was erroneously committed.

2007-08-02 19:58  mleslie

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_jts.c, lwgeom/lwgeom_jts_wrapper.cpp: Added
	  PreparedGeometry and caching support to the intersects function
	  in the jts connector. Created wrapper functions for the
	  PreparedGeometry functionality.

2007-08-02 19:57  mleslie

	* lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c: Removed a call to the
	  deprecated point_in_ring function.

2007-07-31 20:40  mleslie

	* Version.config: Updated the version numbers.

2007-07-26 18:55  mleslie

	  from outer collection.

2006-02-06 11:16  strk

	* lwgeom/lwgeom.h: Added uchar typedef

	  lwgeom/lwgeom_functions_analytic.c, regress/Makefile,
	  regress/run_test, regress/snaptogrid.sql,
	  regress/snaptogrid_expected: Fixed bug in SnapToGrid() bbox
	  computation.
	  Previous policy (WHEN SIMPLE) turned out to be non-simple,
	  so this has been changed to TAINING.
	  Bbox will then be recomputed by scanning output coordinates
	  iff input had a bbox cache.
	  AUTOCACHE_BBOX define (the default) will still force a
	  computation of output box if worth it.
	  Regress tests added for the case reported on postgis-users
	  
	  Run of regress tests do not require postgis install
	  anymore. The library build in source tree will be
	  used for this purpose.
	  
	  Version bumped to 1.1.2 and CHANGES file updated.

2005-12-16 01:41  strk

	* CHANGES, Version.config, lwgeom/Makefile,
	  lwgeom/lwpostgis.sql.in, utils/postgis_proc_upgrade.pl: Unified
	  SCRIPTS, LIB and RELEASE versions for the sake of simplicity.

	  postgis_lib_version()
	  postgis_scripts_installed() return still the same numbers but as
	  written
	  in the database at the time of lwpostgis.sql sourcing.

2005-12-16 01:35  strk

	  w/out changing output.
	  - Moved postgis centroid() version (neither GEOS nor JTS) from
	  lwgeom_functions_basic.c to lwgeom_nojts.c (fails far less
	  times with "redefinition of centroid" errors.)
	  - Made lwpostgis_upgrade.sql build by default (must add a check
	  for perl availability in ./configure.in)

	  being added

2004-06-01 16:16  strk

	* postgis.sql.in: Placed histogram2d type definition in a common
	  place;
	  added find_extent(schema, table, column) and
	  build_histogram2d(histogram,
	  schema, table, column); modified update_geometry_stats() to make
	  use
	  of available f_table_schema and to set statistical fields to NULL
	  for stale records. Thanks to Carl Anderson for the ideas.

	  removed - I've re-added them.

2004-04-08 17:00  dblasby

	* postgis_gist_72.c: Changed ggeometry_consistent to be aware of
	  NULL queries. Ie.
	  select * from <table> where the_geom && null::geometry;

	  the table
	  has NULLs in it.

2004-04-07 23:12  dblasby

	* lwgeom/Makefile, lwgeom/lwgeom.sql.in, lwgeom/lwgeom_api.c,

2004-03-25 00:43  dblasby

	* postgis_fn.c: added function fluffType() that takes POINT
	  LINESTRING or POLYGON

	  Needs to be integrated into a proper Postgresql function and
	  given an
	  SQL CREATE FUNCTION

2004-03-22 09:39  strk

	* postgis.sql.in: Moved AddGeometryColumn and DropGeometryColumn
	  from USE_VERSION
	  blocks to the end of file. Here, differences between versions
	  are handled on a minimun-diff basis, making it easier to
	  understand
	  the differences and to modify the code. Also, diffs have been
	  splitted between pgsql < 73 and >= 73.
	  Added reduced-parameters wrappers to both functions.

2004-03-22 08:18  strk

	* Makefile: postgis_new.sql build by default

	  regardless of the actual overlapping area. Final gain is not
	  applied
	  (formerly 1 / minimun between average feature cells occupation
	  and
	  search_box cells occupation)

2004-03-03 21:59  strk

	* postgis_estimate.c: added check to keep selectivity value in the
	  range of validity (suggested by m.cave)

2004-03-02 11:39  strk

	* Makefile: cpp call for postgis_new.sql creation uses shell
	  redirection for the output file

2004-03-02 11:37  strk

	  separated mapserver into its own section of the documentation

2002-11-22 17:38  dblasby

	* loader/dbfopen.c, loader/getopt.c, loader/shp2pgsql.c,
	  loader/shpopen.c: - cleaned up all the compiler warnings
	  - for getopt.c, this involved moving the line:
	  extern char *getenv(const char *name);
	  outside of the two nested #ifdefs that it was inside, as it is
	  always required (the code that calls it isn't inside any #ifdefs)
	  Perhaps this may break compilation in non-linux/gnu environments?

	  match other Makefile defines.

2002-05-04 20:28  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml: Start of 0.7 documenation edits.

2002-05-02 22:25  dblasby

	* postgis_transform.c: transform_geom() - if it gets and error -38
	  from PROJ.4 (couldnt open
	  grid file) it will try to do the transform without a
	  a datum conversion. This usually occurs if you ask
	  for a re-projection for a point outside where you have
	  grid data for.

2002-04-30 23:37  dblasby

	* Makefile, postgis_transform.c: Better error reporting.

	  postgis_fn.c, postgis_gist.c, postgis_gist.sql.in,
	  postgis_gist_72.c, postgis_gist_72.sql.in, postgis_ops.c: - cut
	  the gist indexing-related functions out of postgis_ops.c and put
	  them in postgis_gist.c, then put the new gist indexing functions
	  for postgres >= 7.2 in the file postgis_gist_72
	  
	  - similarly, the sql definitions of the gist functions have been
	  split into their own new sql.in file, with postgis_gist_72.sql.in
	  containing the new postgres >= 7.2 definitions
	  
	  - the makefile has been updated to compile EITHER postgis_gist.c
	  OR postgis_gist_72.c, and also to process EITHER
	  postgis_gist.sql.in OR postgis_gist_72.sql and add the output to
	  the end of postgis.sql
	  
	  - in order to compile the gist functions for posgres 7.2 or
	  newer, make sure to point your PGSQL_SRC at the new source
	  directory, and uncomment the line in the makefile which says PG72
	  = 1 (near the top)
	  
	  - some functions that were previously in postgis_ops.c were moved
	  to postgis_fn.c, as part of a general cleanup I did when
	  splitting off the gist functions into their own file
	  
	  - some definitions that were previously in postgis.h
	  (unnecessarily) where removed, as they varied depending on which
	  version of postgis_gist was being used
	  
	  - also edited the loader/Makefile to clean up properly

2002-04-26 16:13  pramsey

	* loader/pgsql2shp.c: Column name length limitation removed. Patch

	  the collect(geometry) function which is an aggregate function
	  that
	  takes a group of geometries and turns them into a geometry
	  collection. For
	  example, "select collect(roadsgeom) from roadstable group by
	  roadname"
	  would return one geometrycollection for each unique road name.

2002-03-15 17:10  dblasby

	  "SRID=x;BOX3D(...)". They are now okay to dump/restore.

2002-02-26 23:46  dblasby

	* postgis_inout.c: for bbox only geometries, it will dump as
	  "SRID=x;NULL", and on load, it will be NULL.

2002-02-23 19:04  pramsey

	* loader/README.pgsql2shp, loader/pgsql2shp.c: Patch to pgsql2shp
	  to allow dumping of tables with more than one geometry
	  column, and addition of -g option to specific which geometry
	  column to dump.

	  support to make WKB a full type.

2001-08-30 22:24  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml: Typo in SQL example fixed.

2001-08-24 21:11  dblasby

	  null text fields.

2001-08-24 21:02  dblasby

	* postgis.sql.in, postgis_debug.c, postgis_inout.c, postgis_ops.c:

	  better restrictivity of && searches.
	  Defaulted to 0.005 (in backend/utils/adt/geo_selfuncs.c) - I've
	  changed it
	  to be much smaller. This should work for everything but really
	  really
	  large tables.

2001-08-10 02:21  pramsey

	* doc/postgis.xml: Fixed type in index description.

2001-08-08 22:10  pramsey

	  Makefile.

2001-08-07 21:35  pramsey

	* examples/wkb_reader/readwkb: This binary should not have been in
	  CVS.

2001-08-02 16:50  dblasby

	* postgis.h, postgis.sql.in, postgis_fn.c: Added more openGIS
	  functions:
	  Length2d() is renamed length()
	  perimeter2d() is renamed to perimeter()
	  
	  numgeometries(geometry) works on MULTI* types
	  geometryn(geometry) works on MULTI* types
	  
	  
	  from section 2.1.5.1
	  --------------------
	  startpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  first
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  endpoint(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring, return the
	  last
	  point. Otherwise, return NULL.
	  
	  from section 2.1.9.1/3.2.18.2
	  --------------------
	  
	  centroid(geometry) :- if geometry is a polygon (or multipolygon),
	  return
	  the mathematical centroid (no guaranteed to be on polygon),
	  otherwise
	  return NULL. I define centroid as the average location of all the
	  points
	  in the polygon (outer ring only). For multipolygons, average all
	  the
	  points on all the outer rings.
	  
	  from section 3.2.12.2/3.2.17.2
	  ---------------------
	  isclosed(geometry) :- if geometry is a linestring then returns
	  startpoint == endpoint. If its not a linestring then return NULL.
	  If
	  its a multilinestring, return true only if all the
	  sub-linestrings have
	  startpoint=endpoint.

2001-07-31 19:11  dblasby

	* postgis.h, postgis.sql.in, postgis_fn.c, postgis_inout.c,
	  postgis_ops.c: Added plpgsql functions AddGeometryColumn() and

2001-07-30 17:29  dblasby

	* Makefile, loader/Makefile, postgis.h, postgis.sql.in,
	  postgis_inout.c: Starting to integrate all the SRIDs into
	  functions that create geometries or
	  use two geometries. Throws error if try to compare geometries
	  with different
	  SRIDs.

2001-07-30 16:41  pramsey
