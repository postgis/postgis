	* #2185: bandage for 9.2 EDB x64 basically set all these SQL
	  functions to have a cost of 1 (like the others) so they rarely
	  will ever cache. It's super sugar coating the issue -- there is
	  something I feel wrong with our parser that it's properly
	  cleaning on error and corrupting shared memory when things are
	  cached. but at least regress.sql now passes under 9.2 edb 64

	  remove the extension before finding the non-path section when
	  deriving the table
	  name.

2013-04-13 17:36  mcayland

	* Fix for bug #2272: shp2pgsql-gui crashes when given filenames
	  with dots.
	  
	  This was a combination of two bugs: firstly, we weren't
	  initialising the
	  state variable field_names to NULL, and so if the variable
	  happened to
	  be filled with junk and we were unable to import a shape file, we
	  would
	  end up freeing a random pointer.
	  
	  Secondly, shapelib tries to be clever and strip off any file
	  extension
	  by searching for a "." character from the end of the filename,
	  hence
	  causing the truncation of the filename. Resolve this by leaving
	  the
	  .shp/.dbf extension from the file selector in the filename string
	  so
	  that shapelib does the right thing.

	  The new model avoids a call to GEOSSymDifference but rather
	  checks
	  each candidate node against both "motion ranges" containment.
	  It still constructs something, but only MULTIPOINT, which should
	  be safe. Haven't profiled but the new code should also be faster
	  than the previous. Fixes ticket #2176, includes testcase for it.

	  NOTE: existing clients should take care of calling the new
	  function
	  because their "lwgeom_init_allocators" won't be called anymore.
	  Failure to do so will result in default allocators / reporters
	  being used.

2012-12-18 05:06  robe

	* #1959 remove sql_bits/mark_editable_objects.sql.in from upgrade
	  script. It is the one causing pg_extension table to bloat and in
	  theory not needed for upgrade since we don't change
	  spatial_ref_sys during upgrade.

2012-12-15 20:27  robe

2012-12-15 08:09  robe

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Updated raster2pgsql help and docs to reflect changes to
	  regular_blocking.

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* regular_blocking constraint removed. regular_blocking column of
	  raster_columns now looks for spatially_unique and coverage_tile
	  constraints. Ticket #2150

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added regression tests for ST_IsCoverageTile().

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

2012-12-14 20:27  dustymugs

	* Added parameters to ST_Tile(raster) to control padding of
	  generated tiles.
	  ST_Tile(raster) no longer defaults to padding tiles. Ticket #2069

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Addition of coverage_tile constraint for raster. Ticket #2148

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Addition of ST_IsCoverageTile() to tell if tile is part of a
	  coverage

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	  finished.

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Tweaked the extent computed for the extent constraint

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Changed blocksize constraint to permit multiple possible values.
	  Ticket
	  is #2143. We just need a coverage constraint and a spatially
	  unique
	  constraint to determine regularly blocked.

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* Fixed incorrect return type in docs

2012-12-14 20:26  dustymugs

	* raster2pgsql no longer pads tiles by default based upon tile
	  position and tile
	  size. This is part of the refactoring to remove padded tiles.
	  Flag -P
	  added so that users can indicate that tiles should be padded.
	  Ticket #826.

2012-12-14 20:25  dustymugs

	* Return NULL when simplifying a line results in a line with < 2
	  vertices
	  
	  Also return NULL from ST_Simplify when the input is an empty

	  Yes, both break backward compatibility, but seem more consistent
	  to me. I'm still interested in allowing collapses avoidance but
	  I think consistency is also important.

	* Changed output array of ST_Neighborhood to have dimensions of Y,X

	  increase remove to remove images 0-9 before building next. The
	  remove went from 0-5 and I guess Kevin wasn't counting on anyone
	  crazy enough to have 6 image layers. This code definitely needs
	  some work, but this will do for now.

	* Updated to note bug #1819

2012-05-16 18:47  dustymugs

	* Added ST_Raster2WorldCoord and ST_World2RasterCoord functions to
	  consume
	  RASTER_rasterToWorldCoord and RASTER_worldToRasterCoord
	  functions.
	  Refactored existing ST_Raster2WorldCoord(X|Y) and
	  ST_World2RasterCoord(X|Y) functions to call new functions

	  'C' and 'SQL' to 'c' and 'sql'

2012-05-14 23:28  dustymugs

	* Addition of some commented code. Might be useful if an option is
	  added

2012-05-09 12:08  strk

	* Significatively speedup BuildArea with complex input (#1806)
	  
	  Affects ST_BuildArea, ST_MakeValid and ST_GetFaceGeometry.
	  
	  Replaces the iterated SymDifference used since 2005 with a more
	  scalable algorithm. The new algorithm removes from the
	  polygonized
	  result all polygons whose rings are known to be already
	  represented
	  by holes or shells of other polygons and finally runs a single
	  overlay operation (unary union).
	  
	  With the case attached to ticket #1806, ST_BuildArea completes
	  within 12 seconds using the new code while it takes 27 _minutes_
	  with the old. Both versions return the same result (according to
	  ST_Equals).

2012-05-09 12:08  strk

	* Add unit test for lwgeom_buildarea (useful for #1806)

2012-05-08 16:47  strk

	* ST_BuildArea: arrange polygonized output reducing overlay cost
	  (#1806)
	  
	  By running SymDifference against items with less points first we
	  reduce the overall cost (output vertices tend to always grow).

2012-05-08 16:47  strk

	* Make ST_MakeValid tests immune by coordinates order (using
	  ST_Equals)

2012-04-15 15:47  mcayland

	* Fix #1468: shp2pgsql-gui table column schema get shifted
	  
	  A couple of copy/paste errors meant that the update handler was
	  being invoked
	  a second time on the loader shapefile column name, rather than
	  just once on
	  the schema column.

2012-04-15 15:46  mcayland

	* shp2pgsql-gui: don't allow the user to edit the schema name in
	  the listview.
	  
	  This brings the behaviour in line with that of the table name,
	  and since
	  these entries are generated from the table selector there should
	  be no
	  need to do this.

	* Rework code from r9204 (bug #900: shp2pgsql: a switch to drop M
	  from 4d imports) to fix bug #1710: shp2pgsql -t option is not
	  working properly.
	  
	  The original implementation set the has_z/has_m flags directly
	  based upon the -t parameter; however this lost the information
	  as to how many dimensions were specified. Resolve this by
	  specifying a new force_output configuration variable and setting
	  it to an enumerated constant, so that we can then implement a
	  simple switch() to set both the output dimension and output
	  flags correctly.

	  - Wrap lines to 80 columns, trim trailing whitespace, replace
	  tabs

	  - Fix typos, and use consistent case and punctuation
	  - Alphabetize the directory structure
	  - Add ./libpgcommon to directory structure, and attempt to
	  describe it
	  - Arrange style of REQUIREMENTS section a bit more consistent
	  across components: removing repetition, stating what is required
	  or optional, etc.
	  - When referencing PostGIS SQL functions, use the "ST_" prefix,
	  where applicable
	  - Mention that both Raster and Topology extensions are built by
	  default, add notes how build without them

	  This function computes the minimum tolerance for a given
	  geometry.
	  It works by computing the smallest floating point difference that
	  could be expressed on any vertex of the geometry.
	  
	  Currently it's only used to workaround the ST_DWithin/ST_Within
	  inconsistency (#1625) but could probably be used everytime 0 is
	  passed as a tolerance, possibly fixing #1641 as well.

	* TopoGeo_addPoint: use a more functional tolerance when snapping
	  (#1613)
	  
	  All of this looks like magic but it isn't.
	  I actually wonder if ST_ModEdgeSplit and ST_ModEdgesSplit and
	  ST_Split
	  itself should do this internally, and if in doing so we wouldn't
	  need
	  to do it from higher levels. It doesn't indeed feel comfortable
	  to do
	  all this noise on such an high level.
	  
	  Anyway this commit adds a now-passing regression test for the
	  topology
	  building issue and that's A Good Thing.

	* lwgeom_release (#699), reviewed all usage of lwgeom_release
	  and replaced with lwgeom_free where possible. Changed the
	  def'n of lwgeom_release so that it only frees the containing

	  cases that required a gentler freeing of objects.

	* put in an FAQ about the common function is not unique error that
	  I suspect a lot of people will be running into because they don't
	  cast their geometry inputs and that a lot of raster functions
	  have overloaded functions similar to the geometry ones.

2012-02-05 00:30  mcayland

	* Change encoding reference URL to that used for libiconv rather

	* Fix an issue in the shapefile GUI caused by saving the original
	  shapefile name before processing.
	  
	  This was a bug caused by having two separate passes during
	  export; we were saving the original
	  export shapefile name during the first loop, and so when we came
	  to free() the temporary name
	  at the end of export it would only free the shapefile name from
	  the last iteration, and do it
	  multiple times causing random crashes.

	  original and the final tables.

	* Switch liblwgeom to use the POSTGIS_* defines already generated
	  by configure, rather than passing them in directly.
	  
	  Similar to my previous commit, however here the aim is that by
	  moving the logic outside of make then we can
	  potentially allow other generators (such as CMake) to detect and
	  use other compilers rather than embedding
	  specific -D flags into the command line.

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* Switch NLS build to use the in-built ENABLE_NLS define rather
	  than USE_NLS.
	  
	  The key concept here is that we eliminate all logic from the
	  Makefile and put
	  it in the build system (e.g. configure). By having the logic at
	  this higher
	  layer, we make it much easier to transition to another build
	  system in future
	  such as CMake.

2012-01-14 00:49  mcayland

	* Enable configure to accept the additional parameter
	  --with-gettext=no to disable NLS builds.
	  
	  This makes it possible to explicitly disable builds at configure
	  time if required for
	  platforms where this causes problems such as Windows (see bug
	  #748).

	  minus the

	* Switch shp2pgsql-gui to COPY mode by default for increased speed;

	* Alter shp2pgsql-gui so that we use one connection per file; this
	  makes tracking error state

	* Added column "out_db" to raster_columns. "out_db" is of type

	  raster2pgsql loader regression tests.

	* Commit reworked version of shp2pgsql-gui to the repository.
	  
	  As per my email to postgis-devel, this commit contains a major
	  reworking
	  of the inner core, with many bugfixes. The primary changes are:
	  
	  - Elimination of FILENODE, since we can just use pointers to
	  SHPLOADERCONFIG
	  
	  - Abstract the configuration structures from the GUI interface
	  
	  - Restrict entry to either drag/drop or file chooser
	  
	  - Instead of constantly destroying/creating new dialogs, create
	  them once and then just show/hide them (in particular this
	  enables the file chooser to open at its previous directory)
	  
	  - Add separate connection details and progress bar dialogs
	  
	  - Rework both internals and GUI in preparation for adding dumper
	  support
	  
	  Note that the dumper integration changes are being worked on
	  separately
	  and will be included in a later commit.
