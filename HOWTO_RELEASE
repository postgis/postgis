How to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Date: 2013-11-16

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

Release version is composed by POSTGIS_MAJOR_VERSION, POSTGIS_MINOR_VERSION
and POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION components.

By default only [POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION] increments between releases.
Starting at PostGIS 2.1 in development  POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION should have a dev at the end

[POSTGIS_MINOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO set to 0) when minor
additions have been introduced (one or two functions can be considered
*micro* additions)

[POSTGIS_MAJOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO and MINOR set to 0) when
a dump/reload of existing spatial databases is *REQUIRED* for things
to work or rather *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* to get new functionalities.

Requirements
------------

In order to build a release, you will need to build PostGIS and the 
documentation -- that means having the required software:

* For PostGIS:
  - PostgreSQL 
  - GEOS
  - Proj4
  - GDAL (for raster)
  - json-c (for GeoJSON load support)
* For the docs:
  - xsltproc
  - DocBook XSL scripts
  - ImageMagic
  - DbLatex (for PDF)

Release procedure
-----------------

1) Re-generate the ChangeLog using svn2cl and truncate old legacy junk
2) Edit NEWS: set release date and check all notable changes have
   been reported (extract from ChangeLog).
3) Edit README.postgis and set release date and version.
4) Add release notes in doc/release_notes.xml
5) Commit all your changes
  a) make sure to run the extensions/make_unpackaged.sql on 
    about to release version  and copy contents to  
    (TODO: we need to automate this) 
      postgis/sql_bits/postgis--unpackages.sql.in
      postgis_topology/sql_bits/topology_unpackaged.sql.in
      postgis_tiger_geocoder/sql_bits/tiger_geocoder--unpackaged.sql.in
6) Tag branch:  
   svn copy http://svn.osgeo.org/postgis/branch/x.x http://svn.osgeo.org/postgis/tags/x.x.x
7) Checkout tag:
   svn checkout http://svn.osgeo.org/postgis/tags/x.x.x
8) Update Version.config as specified in Versioning Scheme above. See also 17
9) Update doc/postgis.xml to download.osgeo.org link 
  (note: unreleased are on postgis.net, and released download.osgeo.org )
   Also make sure the correct minimum and lastest geos etc are noted.
10) Commit your version number change to the tag.
11) Run: sh make_dist.sh x.x.x (or use debbie for this)
12) Copy tarball to web site and edit downloads page
13) Announce on e-mail 
    - postgis-users
    - postgis-devel
    - pgsql-announce
    - osgeo-discuss
14) Update web sites
    - PostGIS News
    - https://svn.osgeo.org/postgis/web/_content/posts
       a) create a new Post for current year making sure the page name starts with mm-dd
       b) Update links on https://svn.osgeo.org/postgis/web/_content/pages/source.html
       c) commit and wait 5 minutes to see changes on website
    - PostGIS doc release versioned doc - http://postgis.net/documentation/
     (For building pdf, debbie has tagged jobs 
       -- http://debbie.postgis.net:8080 (log in)
       Create new job copy last tag e.g. PostGIS_2.0_tagged_docs to PostGIS_2.1_tagged_docs
       and make appropriate edits and then just run.
       Or just be lazy and bug Regina Obe do this.
    - Freshmeat
    - Wikipedia
    - Twitter (we all love twitter don't we)
    - PlanetPostGIS
15) Update Trac and make old Milestone as completed

16) Push the revision number forward.  All POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION that are in branch or trunk should end in
dev.  So for example if you just release 2.1.1, then the 2.1 branch should have POSTGIS_MICRO_VERSION set to 2dev 
so that the full version is 2.1.2dev.
17) Ensure all the previous released minor versions are listed in extension/upgradeable_versions.mk including the one you just released
