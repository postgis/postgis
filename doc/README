PostGIS Documentation
=====================

Overview
--------

PostGIS documentation is written in DocBook XML. The input file is
``postgis.xml``, which in turn includes all the individual chapter XML files.
From that file we can publish several formats, including HTML and PDF.

Make targets
------------

``make``
  same as ``make comments``

``make install``
  same as ``make comments-install``

``make uninstall``
  same as ``make comments-uninstall``

``make html``
  generates a single-file ``html/postgis.html``

``make chunked-html``
  generates a separate html file for every chapter or section break

``make pdf``
  generates a single PDF file with the PostGIS version as a filename

``make images``
  generates all the images used in the HTML and PDF targets

``make comments``
  generates an SQL script that add COMMENTs for every function (derived from
  the documentation)

``make doxygen``
  generates the developer's documentation using Doxygen

``make comments-install``
  copies the ``postgis-comments.sql`` script to the PostgreSQL ``contrib``
  directory

``make comments-uninstall``
  removes the ``postgis-comments.sql`` script from the ``contrib`` directory

``make clean``
  removes generated files except comments

``make maintainer-clean``
  removes all generated files (including comments)
