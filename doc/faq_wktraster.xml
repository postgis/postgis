      <question>
        <para> What is the meaning of "WKT" in WKT Raster?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>WKT stands for &quot;Well Known Text&quot;. It is trying to follow the OGC WKT for geometry to provide a standard to represent geographical information in a human readable textual representation. 
        However, the OGC WKT standard does not define a way to represent raster yet. PostGIS WKT Raster is a bit ahead on this :-)</para>

      <question>
        <para>How do I install Raster support in my PostGIS database?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>First you need a working PostGIS 1.3.5 or above database. Then you need to compile GDAL. Then you need to compile WKT Raster if there are no binaries available for your platform.
			If you are on windows, you can compile yourself, or use the <ulink url="http://www.postgis.org/download/windows/experimental.php#wktraster">pre-comiled WKT Raster windows binaries</ulink>.
			If you are on Mac OSX Leopard or Snow Leopard, there are binaries available at <ulink url="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/postgres">Kyng Chaos Mac OSX PostgreSQL/GIS binaries</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>Then to enable raster support in your database, run the rtpostgis.sql file in your database.</para>
		<para>For more details about compiling from source, please refer to <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster/Documentation01#a2.3-CompilingandInstallingfromSources">Installing WKT Raster from source</ulink></para>

      <question>
        <para>I get error could not load library "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/8.4/lib/rtpostgis.dll": The specified module could not be found.
        	or could not load library on Linux when trying to run rtpostgis.sql</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>rtpostgis.so/dll is built with dependency on libgdal.dll/so. Make sure for Windows you have libgdal.dll in the bin folder of your PostgreSQL install.  
        For Linux libgdal has to be in your path or bin folder.  </para>
		<para>You may also run into different errors if you don't have PostGIS installed in your database.  Make sure to install PostGIS first in your 
		database before trying to install the raster support.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How do I load Raster data into PostGIS?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>Currently you need <ulink url="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL 1.6+</ulink> though later versions would be better since they have many memory leak fixes, <ulink url="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/">Python 2.5</ulink> with <ulink url="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/1.6.1">GDAL 1.6 or higher bindings</ulink>, 
			and <ulink url="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy">NumPy</ulink>.</para>
		<para>
			For windows users, installing these components from binary sources is documented in the 
			ReadMe.txt packaged with the <ulink url="http://www.postgis.org/download/windows/experimental.php#wktraster">Windows WKT Raster experimental builds</ulink>.</para>
		<para>Once you have a functioning Python with GDAL and NumPy, you can use the gdal2wktraster.py script packaged with WKT Raster.</para>
		<para>Please refer to <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/frmts_wtkraster.html">gdal2wktraster.py usage</ulink> for more details.</para>

        <para>What kind of raster file formats can I load into my database?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>Any that your gdal library supports. GDAL supported formats are documented <ulink url="http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html">GDAL File Formats</ulink>.</para>
		<para>Your particular gdal install may not support all formats.  To verify the ones supported by your particular gdal install, you can use gdalinfo --formats</para>

      <question>
        <para>Can I export my PostGIS WKT Raster data to other raster formats?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>Yes</para>
		<para>GDAL 1.7+ has a PostGIS WKT Raster driver, but is not compiled in by default. </para>
		<para>The driver currently doesn't support irregularly blocked rasters, 
		although you can store irregularly blocked rasters in PostGIS raster data type.</para>
		<para>If you are compiling from source, you need to include in your configure 
		 <programlisting>--with-pg=path/to/pg_config</programlisting>  to enable the driver.
		 Refer to <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints">GDAL Build Hints</ulink> for tips
		 on building gdal against in various OS platforms.
		 </para>
		 <para>If your version of GDAL is compiled with the WKT Raster driver 
		 you should see PostGIS WKT Raster in list when you do 
		 <programlisting>gdalinfo --formats</programlisting></para>
		 
		 <para>To get a summary about your raster via gdal use gdalinfo:
		 <programlisting>gdalinfo  "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password='whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable"</programlisting>
		 </para>
		
		 <para>To export data to other raster formats, 
		 	use gdal_translate the below will export all data from a table to a PNG file at 10% size.</para>
		 <para>Depending on your pixel band types, some translations may not work if the export format does not support that Pixel type.  
		 For example floating point band types and 32 bit unsigned ints
		 	will not translate easily to JPG or some others.</para>
		 <para>Here is an example simple translation</para>
		  <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password=whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable" C:\somefile.png</programlisting>
		 <para>You can also use SQL where clauses in your export using the where=... in your driver connection string. 
		 	Below are some using a where clause</para>
		 <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password=whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable where="owner='jimmy'" " C:\somefile.png</programlisting>
		 <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password=whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable where='ST_Intersects(rast, ST_SetSRID(ST_Point(-71.032,42.3793),4326) )' " C:\intersectregion.png</programlisting>

    	<question><para>Are their binaries of GDAL available already compiled with PostGIS WKT Raster suppport?</para></question>
    	<answer>
    		<para>Yes. Check out the page <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries">GDAL Binaries</ulink> page.  Any compiled wiht PostgreSQL
    		support should have PostGIS WKT Raster in them.  </para>
    		<para>We know for sure the following windows binaries have PostGIS WKT Raster built in.</para>
    		<para><ulink url="http://fwtools.maptools.org/">FWTools latest stable version for Windows is compiled with WKT Raster support</ulink>.</para>
    		<para>PostGIS WKT Raster is undergoing many changes.  If you want to get the latest nightly build for Windows -- then check out 
		 the Tamas Szekeres  nightly builds built with Visual Studio which contain GDAL trunk, Python Bindings and Mapserver executables.  Just
		 	click the SDK bat and run your commands from there.  <ulink url="http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/">http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/</ulink>.

      <question>
        <para>What tools can I use to view PostGIS raster data?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>You can use MapServer compiled with GDAL 1.7+ and PostGIS WKT Raster driver support to view Raster data.  
        In theory any tool that renders data using GDAL can support PostGIS raster data or 
        support it with fairly minimal effort.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How can I add a PostGIS raster layer to my Mapserver map?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>You can much like you can with any other raster.  
        Refer to <ulink url="http://mapserver.org/input/raster.html">Mapserver Raster processing options</ulink>
        for list of various processing functions you can use with Mapserver raster layers.</para>
        <para>What makes PostGIS raster data particularly interesting, is that since 
        	each tile can have various standard database columns, you can segment it in your data source</para>
        <para>Below is an example of how you would defined a PostGIS raster layer in Mapserver.</para>
        <programlisting>
-- displaying raster with standard raster options

	NAME coolwktraster
	TYPE raster
	STATUS ON
	DATA "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='somedb' user='someuser' password='whatever' 
		schema='someschema' table='cooltable'"	
	PROCESSING "NODATA=0"
	PROCESSING "SCALE=AUTO"
	#... other standard raster processing functions here
	#... classes are optional but useful for 1 band data

      <question>
        <para>How is WKT Raster different than the Oracle SDO_GEORASTER and SDO_RASTER types?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
       	<para>The major advantage of one-georeference-by-raster over one-georeference-by-layer is to allow:</para>
       	<para>* coverages to be not necessarily rectangular (which is often the case of raster coverage covering large extents. See the possible raster arrangements in the documentation)</para>
       	<para>* rasters to overlaps (which is necessary to implement lossless vector to raster conversion) </para>
       	<para>These arrangements are possible in Oracle as well, but they imply the storage of multiple SDO_GEORASTER objects linked to as many SDO_RASTER tables. A complex coverage can lead to hundreds of tables in the database. With WKT Raster you can store a similar raster arrangement into a unique table.</para>

       	<para>It's a bit like if PostGIS would force you to store only full rectangular vector coverage without gaps or overlaps (a perfect rectangular topological layer). 
       	This is very practical in some applications but practice has shown that it is not realistic or desirable for most geographical coverages. Vector structures needs the flexibility to store discontinuous and non-rectangular coverages. 
       	We think it is a big advantage that raster structure should benefit as well. </para>
