	<para>To compile assuming you have all the dependencies in your search path:</para>
	<programlisting>tar xvfz postgis-&last_release_version;.tar.gz
cd postgis-&last_release_version;

	<para>Once postgis is installed, it needs to be enabled in each individual database you want to use it in.</para>
	<note><para>The raster support is currently optional, but installed by default. For enabling using the PostgreSQL 9.1+ extensions model raster is required. Using the extension enable process is preferred and more user-friendly. To spatially enable your database:</para></note>

	<para>For those running PostgreSQL 9.0 or who decided for some reason not to compile with raster support, or just are old-fashioned, here are longer more painful instructions for you:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
		<para>
		  PostgreSQL &min_postgres_version; or higher. A complete installation
		  of PostgreSQL (including server headers) is required. PostgreSQL
		  is available from

		</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>
		  GNU Make (<filename>gmake</filename> or <filename>make</filename>).
		  For many systems, GNU <filename>make</filename> is the default version

	  <listitem>
		<para>
		  GEOS geometry library, version 3.3 or greater, but GEOS 3.4+ is recommended to take full advantage of all the new functions and features.  Without GEOS 3.4,
			you will be missing some major enhancements such as ST_Triangles and long-running function interruption, and improvements to geometry validation and
			making geometries valid such as ST_ValidDetail and ST_MakeValid.  GEOS 3.3.2+ is also required for topology support.  GEOS is available for download from
		  <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">
			http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
		  </ulink> and 3.4+ is backward-compatible with older versions so fairly safe to upgrade.

		<para>
		  GDAL, version 1.8 or higher (1.9 or higher is strongly recommended since some things will not work well or behavior differently with lower versions).  This is required for raster support and to be able to install with <code>CREATE EXTENSION postgis</code> so highly recommended for those running 9.1+.

		  GDAL (pseudo optional) only if you don't want raster and don't care about installing with <code>CREATE EXTENSION postgis</code> can you leave it out.
		  Keep in mind other extensions may have a requires postgis extension which will prevent you from installing them unless you install postgis as an extension. So it is highly recommended you compile with GDAL support.

                  SFCGAL, version 0.2 (or higher) could be used to provide additional 2D and 3D advanced analysis functions to PostGIS cf <xref linkend="reference_sfcgal" />. And also allow to use SFCGAL rather than GEOS for some 2D functions provided by both backends (like ST_Intersection or ST_Area, for instance). A PostgreSQL configuration variable <code>postgis.backend</code> allow end user to control which backend he want to use if SFCGAL is installed (GEOS by default). Nota: SFCGAL 0.2 require at least CGAL 4.1.

	<para>
	  The PostGIS module is an extension to the PostgreSQL backend server. As
	  such, PostGIS &last_release_version; <emphasis>requires</emphasis> full

		This is a workaround for bogus C++ exceptions interaction with older

Description | PostGIS topology spatial types and functions</screen>

<warning><para>Extension tables <varname>spatial_ref_sys</varname>, <varname>layer</varname>, <varname>topology</varname> can not be explicitly backed up.  They can only 
be backed up when the respective <varname>postgis</varname> or <varname>postgis_topology</varname> extension is backed up, which only seems to happen when you backup the whole database. 
As of PostGIS 2.0.1, only srid records not packaged with PostGIS are backed up when the database is backed up so don't go around changing srids we package and expect your changes to be there. Put in a ticket if you find an issue.  The structures of extension tables are never backed up since they are created with <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
and assumed to be the same for a given version of an extension. These behaviors are built into the current PostgreSQL extension model, so nothing we can do about it.</para></warning>

<para>If you installed &last_release_version;, without using our wonderful extension system, you can change it to be extension based by first upgrading to the latest micro version running the upgrade scripts: <filename>postgis_upgrade_20_minor.sql</filename>,<filename>raster_upgrade_20_minor.sql</filename>,<filename>topology_upgrade_20_minor.sql</filename>.</para>
<para>If you installed postgis without raster support, you'll need to install raster support first (using the full <filename>rtpostgis.sql</filename></para>
<para>Then you can run the below commands to package the functions in their respective extension.</para>
<programlisting>CREATE EXTENSION postgis FROM unpackaged;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology FROM unpackaged;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder FROM unpackaged;</programlisting>

	  <title>Testing</title>

	  <para>
		If you wish to test the PostGIS build, run
	  </para>

	  <para>
		<command>make check</command>
	  </para>

	  <para>
		The above command will run through various checks and regression tests
		using the generated library against an actual PostgreSQL database.
	  </para>

	  <note>
		<para>
		  If you configured PostGIS using non-standard PostgreSQL, GEOS, or
		  Proj4 locations, you may need to add their library locations to the
		  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
		</para>
	  </note>

	  <caution>
		<para>
		  Currently, the <command>make check</command> relies on the
		  <code>PATH</code> and <code>PGPORT</code> environment variables when
		  performing the checks - it does <emphasis>not</emphasis> use the
		  PostgreSQL version that may have been specified using the
		  configuration parameter <command>--with-pgconfig</command>. So make
		  sure to modify your PATH to match the detected PostgreSQL installation
		  during configuration or be prepared to deal with the impending
		  headaches.
		</para>
	  </caution>

	  <para>
		If successful, the output of the test should be similar to the
		following:

To use this new normalizer, you compile the pagc extension and install as an extension in your database.</para>
