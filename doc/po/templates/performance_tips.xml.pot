"Current PostgreSQL versions (including 9.6) suffer from a query optimizer "
"weakness regarding TOAST tables. TOAST tables are a kind of \"extension room"
"\" used to store large (in the sense of data size) values that do not fit "
"into normal data pages (like long texts, images or complex geometries with "
"lots of vertices), see <ulink url=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/"
"static/storage-toast.html\">the PostgreSQL Documentation for TOAST</ulink> "
"for more information)."

"The problem appears if you happen to have a table with rather large "
"geometries, but not too many rows of them (like a table containing the "
"boundaries of all European countries in high resolution). Then the table "
"itself is small, but it uses lots of TOAST space. In our example case, the "
"table itself had about 80 rows and used only 3 data pages, but the TOAST "
"table used 8225 pages."

"Now issue a query where you use the geometry operator &amp;&amp; to search "
"for a bounding box that matches only very few of those rows. Now the query "
"optimizer sees that the table has only 3 pages and 80 rows. It estimates "
"that a sequential scan on such a small table is much faster than using an "
"index. And so it decides to ignore the GIST index. Usually, this estimation "
"is correct. But in our case, the &amp;&amp; operator has to fetch every "
"geometry from disk to compare the bounding boxes, thus reading all TOAST "
"pages, too."

"The PostgreSQL people are trying to solve this issue by making the query "

msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#: performance_tips.xml:50
#, no-c-format
msgid ""
"The first workaround is to force the query planner to use the index. Send "
"\"SET enable_seqscan TO off;\" to the server before issuing the query. This "
"basically forces the query planner to avoid sequential scans whenever "
"possible. So it uses the GIST index as usual. But this flag has to be set on "
"every connection, and it causes the query planner to make misestimations in "
"other cases, so you should \"SET enable_seqscan TO on;\" after the query."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#: performance_tips.xml:58
#, no-c-format
msgid ""
"The second workaround is to make the sequential scan as fast as the query "
"planner thinks. This can be achieved by creating an additional column that "
"\"caches\" the bbox, and matching against this. In our example, the commands "
"are like:"
msgstr ""

#. Tag: programlisting

#, no-c-format

"SELECT "
"AddGeometryColumn('myschema','mytable','bbox','4326','GEOMETRY','2');\n"

msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#: performance_tips.xml:65
#, no-c-format

"Now change your query to use the &amp;&amp; operator against bbox instead of "
"geom_column, like:"

"SELECT geom_column\n"

"Of course, if you change or add rows to mytable, you have to keep the bbox "
"\"in sync\". The most transparent way to do this would be triggers, but you "
"also can modify your application to keep the bbox column current or run the "
"UPDATE query above after every modification."

"For tables that are mostly read-only, and where a single index is used for "
"the majority of queries, PostgreSQL offers the CLUSTER command. This command "
"physically reorders all the data rows in the same order as the index "
"criteria, yielding two performance advantages: First, for index range scans, "
"the number of seeks on the data table is drastically reduced. Second, if "
"your working set concentrates to some small intervals on the indices, you "
"have a more efficient caching because the data rows are spread along fewer "
"data pages. (Feel invited to read the CLUSTER command documentation from the "
"PostgreSQL manual at this point.)"

"Of course, this will not work if you in fact need NULL values in your "

"Sometimes, you happen to have 3D or 4D data in your table, but always access "

"In case of large tables, it may be wise to divide this UPDATE into smaller "
"portions by constraining the UPDATE to a part of the table via a WHERE "
"clause and your primary key or another feasible criteria, and running a "
"simple \"VACUUM;\" between your UPDATEs. This drastically reduces the need "
"for temporary disk space. Additionally, if you have mixed dimension "
"geometries, restricting the UPDATE by \"WHERE dimension(the_geom)&gt;2\" "
"skips re-writing of geometries that already are in 2D."
