"PostGIS has begun a transition from the existing naming convention to an SQL-"
"MM-centric convention. As a result, most of the functions that you know and "
"love have been renamed using the standard spatial type (ST) prefix. Previous "
"functions are still available, though are not listed in this document where "
"updated functions are equivalent. The non ST_ functions not listed in this "
"documentation are deprecated and will be removed in a future release so STOP "
"USING THEM."
