Translation files for the PostGIS manual.

Compilation of the files require the ``poxml`` package,
part of the KDE development kit.

In language subdirectories, run ``make`` to build localized manual and
comments, ``make local-pdf`` for the pdf.

In parent directory (doc), run ``make update-po`` to update the translation
files to be in sync with the source code, ``make html-localized`` or
``make pdf-localized`` to build the localized html or pdf manual for
all enabled languages

Adding languages
----------------

Adding new languages implies (relative to doc/ dir):

  - Adding the language to the `translations` variable
    in Makefile.in

  - Re-running ./configure

  - Running `make update-po`

  - Adding a Makefile under the new language directory
    (take the Makefile from another language as a template,
    and only change the DOCSUFFIX)

  - Check the new language works:
    make -C po/<newlanguage>

  - Add to the git repository the changes in the Makefile.in
    and all the new files in the po/<newlanguage>/

Using weblate
-------------

Weblate web-ui to translation was setup here:
https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis

Translations made via Weblate will automatically be pushed
to the master branch of the official repository.

Translation directly pushed to the master branch of the
official reporitory will be automatically pulled by Weblate,
as well as changes to the templates (.pot files).
Pulling is triggered by a webhook, see
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/postgis/postgis/settings/hooks
