"Reporting bugs effectively is a fundamental way to help PostGIS development. "
"The most effective bug report is that enabling PostGIS developers to "
"reproduce it, so it would ideally contain a script triggering it and every "
"information regarding the environment in which it was detected. Good enough "
"info can be extracted running <code>SELECT postgis_full_version()</code> "
"[for postgis] and <code>SELECT version()</code> [for postgresql]."
