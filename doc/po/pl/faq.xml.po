"Short Answer: geography is a newer data type that supports long range "

"supporting it, enjoys greater support from third party tools, and operations "
"on it are generally faster -- sometimes as much as 10 fold faster for larger "
"geometries. Geometry is best if you are pretty comfortable with spatial "
