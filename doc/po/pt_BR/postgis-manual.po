"The first workaround is to force the query planner to use the index. Send "
"\"SET enable_seqscan TO off;\" to the server before issuing the query. This "
"basically forces the query planner to avoid sequential scans whenever "
"possible. So it uses the GIST index as usual. But this flag has to be set on "
"every connection, and it causes the query planner to make misestimations in "
"other cases, so you should \"SET enable_seqscan TO on;\" after the query."
msgstr ""
"A primeira solução é forçar o estimador de pesquisar a utilizar o índice. "
"Emita um comando \"SET enable_seqscan TO off\" ao servidor antes de emitir a "
"pesquisa. Isto força o estimador a evitar scans sequenciais sempre que "
"possível, utilizando o índice GIST como de costume. Mas esta flag deve ser "
"setada para cada conexão e causa o estimador a decidir mal em outros casos, "
"portanto, você deve habilitar \"SET enable_seqscan TO on;\" após a pesquisa."

"The second workaround is to make the sequential scan as fast as the query "
"planner thinks. This can be achieved by creating an additional column that "

"are like:"

"A segunda solução é fazer a pesquisa sequencial tão rápida quanto o "
"estimador imagina. Isto pode ser feito criando uma coluna adicional que "

msgstr ""
"Claro, se você alterar ou adicionar colunas a mytable, você deve manter o "

"Alterações: 2.0.0 não funciona mais com geometrias de multilinestrings. Em "
"verões mais antigas do PostGIS -- uma linha multilinestring sozinha "
"trabalharia normalmente com essa função e voltaria o ponto de início. Na "
"2.0.0 ela retorna NULA como qualquer outra multilinestring. O antigo "
"comportamento não foi uma característica documentada, mas as pessoas que "
"consideravam que tinham seus dados armazenados como uma LINESTRING, agora "
"podem experimentar essas que retornam NULAS em 2.0. "

"você tem uma pasta com arquivos de imagens de 5000x5000 pixel e você escolhe "
"ordenar 125x125, para cada arquivo de imagem sua tabela base terá "

"have ceiling(1600/Power(2,2)) = 400 rows, your (l=3) <varname>o_3</varname> "
"will have ceiling(1600/Power(2,3) ) = 200 rows. Se seus pixels não são "
"visíveis pelo tamanho das suas tiles, você pegará algumas tiles sobras (que "
"não estão completamente cheias). Note que cada tile panorama gerada pelo "
"raster2pgsql tem o meso número de pixels de seus pais, mas é de uma "
