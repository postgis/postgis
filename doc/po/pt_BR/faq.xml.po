"to upgrade to the latest versions of these which have many of these issues "
"fixed. For your own code, you can change your code to not use the functions "
"removed. Most of these functions are non ST_ aliases of ST_Union, ST_Length "

"Short Answer: geography is a new data type that supports long range "
"distances measurements, but most computations on it are currently slower "
"than they are on geometry. If you use geography -- you don't need to learn "
"much about planar coordinate systems. Geography is generally best if all you "
"care about is measuring distances and lengths and you have data from all "
"over the world. Geometry data type is an older data type that has many more "
"functions supporting it, enjoys greater support from third party tools, and "
"operations on it are generally faster -- sometimes as much as 10 fold faster "
"for larger geometries. Geometry is best if you are pretty comfortable with "
"spatial reference systems or you are dealing with localized data where all "
"your data fits in a single <link linkend=\"spatial_ref_sys\">spatial "
"reference system (SRID)</link>, or you need to do a lot of spatial "
"processing. Note: It is fairly easy to do one-off conversions between the "
