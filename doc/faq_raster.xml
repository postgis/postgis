      <question>
        <para>How do I install Raster support in my PostGIS database?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>The easiest is to download binaries for PostGIS and Raster which are currently available for windows and latest versions of Mac OSX. 
        	First you need a working PostGIS 2.0.0 or above and be running PostgreSQL 8.4, 9.0, or 9.1. Note in PostGIS 2.0 PostGIS Raster is fully integrated, so it will be compiled when you compile PostGIS.</para>
        	<para>Instructions for installing and running under windows are available at <ulink url="http://gis4free.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/how-to-install-and-configure-postgis-raster-on-windows/">How to Install and Configure PostGIS raster on windows</ulink></para>
        <para>
			If you are on windows, you can compile yourself, or use the <ulink
            url="http://www.postgis.org/download/windows/experimental.php#wktraster">pre-compiled
            PostGIS Raster windows binaries</ulink>.
			If you are on Mac OSX Leopard or Snow Leopard, there are binaries available at <ulink url="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/postgres">Kyng Chaos Mac OSX PostgreSQL/GIS binaries</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>Then to enable raster support in your database, run the rtpostgis.sql file in your database.  To upgrade an existing install use rtpostgis_upgrade_minor..sql instead of rtpostgis.sql</para>
		<para>For other platforms, you generally need to compile yourself. Dependencies are PostGIS and GDAL. For more details about compiling from source, please refer to <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/WKTRaster/Documentation01#a2.3-CompilingandInstallingfromSources">Installing PostGIS Raster from source (in prior versions of PostGIS)</ulink></para>

      <question>
        <para>I get error could not load library "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/8.4/lib/rtpostgis.dll": The specified module could not be found.
        	or could not load library on Linux when trying to run rtpostgis.sql</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>rtpostgis.so/dll is built with dependency on libgdal.dll/so. Make sure for Windows you have libgdal-1.dll in the bin folder of your PostgreSQL install.  
        For Linux libgdal has to be in your path or bin folder.  </para>
		<para>You may also run into different errors if you don't have PostGIS installed in your database.  Make sure to install PostGIS first in your 
		database before trying to install the raster support.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How do I load Raster data into PostGIS?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>The latest version of PostGIS comes packaged with a <varname>raster2pgsql</varname> raster loader executable capable of loading many kinds of rasters and also generating lower resolution overviews without any additional software. Please refer to <xref linkend="RT_Raster_Loader" /> for more details. Pre-2.0 versions came with a <varname>raster2pgsql.py</varname> that required python with numpy and GDAL.  This is no longer needed.</para>

      <question>
        <para>What kind of raster file formats can I load into my database?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>Any that your GDAL library supports. GDAL supported formats are documented <ulink url="http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html">GDAL File Formats</ulink>.</para>
		<para>Your particular GDAL install may not support all formats.  To verify the ones supported by your particular GDAL install, you can use</para>

      <question>
        <para>Can I export my PostGIS raster data to other raster formats?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>Yes</para>
		<para>GDAL 1.7+ has a PostGIS raster driver, but is only compiled in if you choose to compile with PostgreSQL support. </para>
		<para>The driver currently doesn't support irregularly blocked rasters, 
		although you can store irregularly blocked rasters in PostGIS raster data type.</para>
		<para>If you are compiling from source, you need to include in your configure 
		 <programlisting>--with-pg=path/to/pg_config</programlisting>  to enable the driver.
		 Refer to <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints">GDAL Build Hints</ulink> for tips
		 on building GDAL against in various OS platforms.
		 </para>
		 <para>If your version of GDAL is compiled with the PostGIS Raster driver 
		 you should see PostGIS Raster in list when you do 
		 <programlisting>gdalinfo --formats</programlisting></para>
		 
		 <para>To get a summary about your raster via GDAL use gdalinfo:
		 <programlisting>gdalinfo  "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password='whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable"</programlisting>
		 </para>
		
		 <para>To export data to other raster formats, 
		 	use gdal_translate the below will export all data from a table to a PNG file at 10% size.</para>
		 <para>Depending on your pixel band types, some translations may not work if the export format does not support that Pixel type.  
		 For example floating point band types and 32 bit unsigned ints
		 	will not translate easily to JPG or some others.</para>
		 <para>Here is an example simple translation</para>
		  <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password='whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable" C:\somefile.png</programlisting>
		 <para>You can also use SQL where clauses in your export using the where=... in your driver connection string. 
		 	Below are some using a where clause</para>
		 <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password='whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable where='filename=\'abcd.sid\''" " C:\somefile.png</programlisting>
		 <programlisting>gdal_translate -of PNG -outsize 10% 10% "PG:host=localhost port=5432 dbname='mygisdb' user='postgres' password='whatever' schema='someschema' table=sometable where='ST_Intersects(rast, ST_SetSRID(ST_Point(-71.032,42.3793),4326) )' " C:\intersectregion.png</programlisting>

    	<question><para>Are their binaries of GDAL available already compiled with PostGIS Raster suppport?</para></question>
    	<answer>
    		<para>Yes. Check out the page <ulink url="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries">GDAL Binaries</ulink> page.  Any compiled with PostgreSQL
    		support should have PostGIS Raster in them.  </para>
    		<para>PostGIS Raster is undergoing many changes.  If you want to get the latest nightly build for Windows -- then check out 
		 the Tamas Szekeres  nightly builds built with Visual Studio which contain GDAL trunk, Python Bindings and MapServer executables and PostGIS Raster driver built-in.  Just
		 	click the SDK bat and run your commands from there.  <ulink url="http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/">http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/</ulink>.
		 	Also available are VS project files.</para>

      <question>
        <para>What tools can I use to view PostGIS raster data?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>You can use MapServer compiled with GDAL 1.7+ and PostGIS Raster driver support to view Raster data. QuantumGIS (QGIS) now supports viewing of PostGIS Raster if you
        have PostGIS raster driver installed.</para>
        <para>In theory any tool that renders data using GDAL can support PostGIS raster data or 
        support it with fairly minimal effort. Again for Windows, Tamas' binaries <ulink url="http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/">http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk/</ulink> are a good choice if you don't want the hassle of having to setup to compile your own.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How can I add a PostGIS raster layer to my MapServer map?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>First you need GDAL 1.7 or higher compiled with PostGIS raster support.  
            GDAL 1.8 or above is preferred since many issues have been fixed in 1.8 and more PostGIS raster issues fixed in trunk version.</para>
        <para>You can much like you can with any other raster.  
        Refer to <ulink url="http://mapserver.org/input/raster.html">MapServer Raster processing options</ulink>
        for list of various processing functions you can use with MapServer raster layers.</para>
        <para>What makes PostGIS raster data particularly interesting, is that since 
        	each tile can have various standard database columns, you can segment it in your data source</para>
        <para>Below is an example of how you would define a PostGIS raster layer in MapServer.</para>
        <note><para>The mode=2 is required for tiled rasters and was added in PostGIS 2.0 and GDAL 1.8 drivers.  This does not exist in GDAL 1.7 drivers.</para></note>

      <question>
        <para>I am getting error  ERROR:  function st_intersects(raster, unknown) is not unique or st_union(geometry,text) is not unique.  How do I fix?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
        <para>The function is not unique error happens if one of your arguments is a textual representation of a geometry instead of a geometry.  In these cases, PostgreSQL marks the textual representation as an unknown type, which means it can fall into the st_intersects(raster, geometry) or st_intersects(raster,raster) thus resulting in a non-unique case since both functions can in theory support your request.  To prevent this, you need to cast the geometry to a geometry.</para>
        <para>For example if your code looks like this:</para>
        <programlisting>SELECT rast
 FROM my_raster
   WHERE ST_Intersects(rast, 'SRID=4326;POINT(-10 10)');</programlisting>
   		<para>Cast the textual geometry representation to a geometry by changing your code to this:</para>
   		<programlisting>SELECT rast
 FROM my_raster
   WHERE ST_Intersects(rast, 'SRID=4326;POINT(-10 10)'::geometry);</programlisting>

      <question>
        <para>How is PostGIS Raster different from Oracle GeoRaster (SDO_GEORASTER) and SDO_RASTER types?</para>
      </question>

      <answer>
      	<para>For a more extensive discussion on this topic, check out Jorge Arévalo <ulink url="http://gis4free.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/oracle-georaster-part-i/">Oracle GeoRaster and PostGIS Raster: First impressions </ulink></para>
       	<para>The major advantage of one-georeference-by-raster over one-georeference-by-layer is to allow:</para>
       	<para>* coverages to be not necessarily rectangular (which is often the case of raster coverage covering large extents. See the possible raster arrangements in the documentation)</para>
       	<para>* rasters to overlaps (which is necessary to implement lossless vector to raster conversion) </para>
       	<para>These arrangements are possible in Oracle as well, but they imply
        the storage of multiple SDO_GEORASTER objects linked to as many
        SDO_RASTER tables. A complex coverage can lead to hundreds of tables in
        the database. With PostGIS Raster you can store a similar raster arrangement into a unique table.</para>

       	<para>It's a bit like if PostGIS would force you to store only full rectangular vector coverage without gaps or overlaps (a perfect rectangular topological layer). 
       	This is very practical in some applications but practice has shown that it is not realistic or desirable for most geographical coverages. Vector structures needs the flexibility to store discontinuous and non-rectangular coverages. 
       	We think it is a big advantage that raster structure should benefit as well. </para>
