  <para>The functions given below are the ones which a user of PostGIS is
  likely to need. There are other functions which are required support
  functions to the PostGIS objects which are not of use to a general
  user.</para>

  <note>
	<para>PostGIS has begun a transition from the existing naming convention
	to an SQL-MM-centric convention. As a result, most of the functions that
	you know and love have been renamed using the standard spatial type (ST)
	prefix. Previous functions are still available, though are not listed in
	this document where updated functions are equivalent. The non ST_ functions not listed in this documentation are
	deprecated and will be removed in a future release so STOP USING THEM.</para>
