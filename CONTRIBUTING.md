PostGIS development planning happens via a [Trac instance](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/).

In order for proper scheduling of contributions acceptance/merging it
is recommended to file a ticket there and add your patch or a link
to a patch or to a public git branch where your development is ongoing.

Filing a ticket requires setting up an OSGeo account, which lets you
contribute to every project of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/).

As we understand you might not want to setup a new account, simply
filing a pull request on one of the [PostGIS code mirrors](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/CodeMirrors) is also welcome,
but it is easier for such contributions to miss our radars unless
it _also_ has a matching Trac ticket.

If you intend to be involved for more than an occasional patch we
recommend you to subscribe to the [development mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/postgis-devel).

Note that We also welcome
[git patches via email](https://git-send-email.io)
