To use the PostGIS types, you must:
- have the postgis.jar in your CLASSPATH
- have a PostgreSQL JDBC Connection instance

  Connection conn = new Connection();
  ((org.postgresql.Connection)conn).addDataType("geometry","org.postgis.PGgeometry");
  ((org.postgresql.Connection)conn).addDataType("box3d","org.postgis.PGbox3d");

To build the examples:
- put the jar file containing the PostgreSQL JDBC under 
  postgis/original/jars/postgresql.jar
  The file might be named jdbc7.1-1.2.jar originally

- edit the file TestServer.java to adjust the connection information, run
  the test with 'make jtest'
