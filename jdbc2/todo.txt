Todo for PostGIS 1.0 compatible JDBC classes

- Review RADME

- Review Makefile

- Testing

- WKT parsing of M and 4d geometries

- Handling of length() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Handling of hashCode() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Test correctness of toString() and getValue() for compatibility reasons

- PGbox3D and newly created PGbox cleanup and tests

- Check whether servertest still works.

- See where the code can be cleaned and leaned.

- Run tests against other PostGIS releases (I did 0.8 and 1.0CVS).

- Evaluate whether and how we should drop ".0" in WKT creation for ordinates 
  that happen to be integers.
  
- Review copyright notices in source files.

- Possibly relicensing under LGPL
