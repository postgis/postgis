-- This function finds the id of a face whose geometry
-- would properly contain the given query point.
--
-- The implementation of this function relies on a properly built
-- topology, so results against an invalid topology are unpredictable.
--
-- If the point falls on the boundary of any face an exception will be
-- raised. Dangling edges will not be considered as face boundaries,
-- which is consistent with ST_GetFaceGeometry.
--
-- The following query should always return true
-- for non-boundary query points (:point)
--
--  ST_Contains(
--    ST_GetFaceGeometry(
--       :topo,
--       ST_GetFaceContainingPoint(:topo, :point)
--    ),
--    :point
--  )
