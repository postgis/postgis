- Clean up mapserver connectivity
- Submit to OpenGIS Consortium for testing
- Update PgSQL GiST to support row level (rectangle level?) locking.
- Network creation and network operations 
  (upstream, downstream, least cost path)
- Standardized handling for topology and coverages with 
  support functions.
- casts between PostGIS and PostgreSQL geometry classes

======================================
Following is TODO list for release 1.1
======================================

======================================

- LineMerge interface
	(done for GEOS, should do for JTS)

+ Better upgrade mechanism

- Selectivity estimation code merge (+- pgsql-8.0.0)
	+ fix invalid stats computation (currently keeps the previously
	  computed ones, should instead wipe them out - possibly a
	  pgsql bug).

- Special threatment of SRID=-1, dims=-1, type=GEOMETRY
  in geometry_columns

- Better regression tests (single load, multi operations)

- MakeValidShape() to remove consecutive vertexes and any eventual
  other cleanup aimed at making pgsql2shp produce "valid" Shapefiles.

- OGC polygon constructors


2005/09/07 - some other ideas for future features

- Add findsrid() functions that find good carthesian projection
  srids for a given geometry.
  
- Treat geometries without SRID=-1 as compatible with all other
  geometries in geometry operations
